BART_START_DOCSTRING = r"""

    This model is a PyTorch `torch.nn.Module <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module>`_ sub-class.
    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general
    usage and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config (:class:`~transformers.BartConfig`): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the
            model. Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration.
            Check out the :meth:`~transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained` method to load the model weights.

BART_INPUTS_DOCSTRING = r"""
    Args:
        input_ids (:obj:`torch.LongTensor` of shape :obj:`(batch_size, sequence_length)`):
            Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.

            Indices can be obtained using :class:`transformers.BartTokenizer`.
            See :func:`transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.encode` and
            :func:`transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.encode_plus` for details.

            `What are input IDs? <../glossary.html#input-ids>`__
        attention_mask (:obj:`torch.FloatTensor` of shape :obj:`(batch_size, sequence_length)`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`None`):
            Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices.
            Mask values selected in ``[0, 1]``:
            ``1`` for tokens that are NOT MASKED, ``0`` for MASKED tokens.
