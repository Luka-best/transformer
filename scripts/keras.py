# Title: Enhanced Model Debugging Tool
# Description: Introduce a feature enabling real-time visualization and debugging during model training. 
# This tool should allow users to observe weight, bias adjustments, and activation function outputs at each layer, 
# aiding in efficient model tuning and troubleshooting.

# Note: The actual implementation of this feature would require a thorough understanding of TensorFlow's 
# internal workings and would likely involve modifications to its source code, which is beyond the scope 
# of this example. However, the comments provide a conceptual overview of what such a feature might involve.

# Import necessary libraries
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    # Add a dense layer with 10 units and input shape of 20
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(20,))
])

# Compile the model with loss and optimizer
model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer='adam')

# Note: The new feature would involve creating a debugging tool that could be integrated into TensorFlow’s training loop.
# This tool would provide real-time insights into the model's training process, such as visualizing the adjustments 
# being made to the model’s weights and biases, and how the outputs of each activation function are changing after 
# each epoch. This could be achieved through various visualization libraries and would require a deep integration 
# with TensorFlow’s training process to access and visualize this data in real-time.

# Example usage of the new feature might look like this:

# Train the model with the new debugging tool
# model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, callbacks=[CustomDebuggingTool()])
