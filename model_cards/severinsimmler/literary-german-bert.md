# German BERT for literary texts

This German BERT is based on `bert-base-german-dbmdz-cased`, and has been adapted to the domain of literary texts by fine-tuning the language modeling task on the [Corpus of German-Language Fiction](https://figshare.com/articles/Corpus_of_German-Language_Fiction_txt_/4524680/1). Afterwards the model was fine-tuned for named entity recognition on the [DROC](https://gitlab2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/kallimachos/DROC-Release) corpus, i.e. you can use it to recognize (mostly fictional) protagonists in German novels.
