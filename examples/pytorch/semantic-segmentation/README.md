# Semantic segmentation example

This directory contains a script, `run_semantic_segmentation_no_trainer.py`, that showcases how to fine-tune any model supported by the [`AutoModelForSemanticSegmentation` API](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModelForSemanticSegmentation) (such as [SegFormer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/segformer), [BEiT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/beit), [DPT]((https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/dpt))) for semantic segmentation using PyTorch.

The script leverages [ðŸ¤— `Accelerate`](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate), which allows to write your own training loop in PyTorch, but have it run instantly on any (distributed) environment, including CPU, multi-CPU, GPU, multi-GPU and TPU. It also supports mixed precision. 

First, run:

```bash
accelerate config
```

and reply to the questions asked regarding the environment on which you'd like to train. Then

```bash
accelerate test
```

that will check everything is ready for training. Finally, you can launch training with

```bash
accelerate launch --output_dir segformer-finetuned-sidewalk --wandb --push_to_hub
```

and boom, you're training, possibly on multiple GPUs, logging everything to Weights and Biases and regularly pushing your model to the hub :)

With the default settings, the script fine-tunes a [SegFormer]((https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/segformer)) model on the [segments/sidewalk-semantic](segments/sidewalk-semantic) dataset.

The resulting model can be seen here: https://huggingface.co/nielsr/segformer-finetuned-sidewalk.

## Reload and perform inference

This means that after training, you can easily load your trained model as follows:

```python
from transformers import AutoFeatureExtractor, AutoModelForSemanticSegmentation

model_name = "name_of_repo_on_the_hub_or_path_to_local_folder"

feature_extractor = AutoFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForSemanticSegmentation.from_pretrained(model_name)
```

and perform inference as follows:

```python
from PIL import Image
import requests
import torch

url = "http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg"
image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

# prepare image for the model
inputs = feature_extractor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")

with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    logits = outputs.logits

# rescale logits to original image size
logits = nn.functional.interpolate(outputs.logits.detach().cpu(),
                                    size=image.size[::-1], # (height, width)
                                    mode='bilinear',
                                    align_corners=False)

predicted = logits.argmax(1)
```

For visualization of the segmentation maps, we refer to the [example notebook](https://github.com/NielsRogge/Transformers-Tutorials/blob/master/SegFormer/Segformer_inference_notebook.ipynb).

## Important notes

Some datasets, like [`scene_parse_150`](scene_parse_150), contain a "background" label that is not part of the classes. The Scene Parse 150 dataset for instance contains labels between 0 and 150, with 0 being the background class, and 1 to 150 being actual class names (like "tree", "person", etc.). For these kind of datasets, one replaces the background label (0) by 255, which is the `ignore_index` of the PyTorch model's loss function, and reduces all labels by 1. This way, the `labels` are PyTorch tensors containing values between 0 and 149, and 255 for all background/padding.

In case you're training on such a dataset, make sure to set the ``reduce_labels`` flag, which will take care of this.
