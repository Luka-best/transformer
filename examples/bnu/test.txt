The present model addresses fatigue, creep and oxidation on life prediction.	0
Ni-based superalloys have been extensively used in aerospace and nuclear structural applications, which are called “creep brittle” material according to their superior tensile strength and low creep ductility. Among them, GH4169 is a candidate material for fabricating rotating components of aero engines in China due to its similar mechanical properties to the extensively studied IN718 alloy . Microstructurally, the two types of alloys usually obtain their extremely high strength from the Ni3Nb type γ″ precipitation and partially by Ni3Al type γ′ precipitation, and to even greater extent from precipitates within the solid solution γ matrix. However, an obvious degradation of mechanical properties occurs at temperatures above 650 °C due to the fact that strengthening γ″ precipitation heavily transforms to the equilibrium δ phase . The turbine disks in service not only undergo frequent start-ups and shut-downs, but also withstand inherent stress relaxation during steady operations . In such a condition, the effects of fatigue, creep, environmental attack and the underlying microstructure evolution at elevated temperatures must be considered . The time-independent deformation in the LCF regime is dominated by the occurrence of extrusions and intrusions at surface grains, the development of persistent slip bands, the formation of surface cracks, and finally the result of transgranular crack propagation . The time-dependent effect on fatigue behavior always leads to the failure path transforming from transgranular to trans-plus intergranular mode .	0
In the creep-fatigue regime, various efforts have been devoted to evaluate microstructure evolution in Ni-based GH4169 and IN 718 alloys . Chen et al.  conducted both LCF and creep-fatigue tests of GH4169 alloy at 650 °C, in which all the fracture appearances were manifested in a brittle fracture mode. Nevertheless, comparing with LCF tests, the presence of hold periods often cause more significant intergranular cracking and fracture mode, which can be respectively observed from the surface cracks and fracture appearances. Prasad et al.  reported that the possible reason for intergranular cracking mode was the conjoined effect of planar slip, linking-up of grain boundary voids and oxidation-assisted cracking. However, slip-induced intergranular cracking was not a primary damage mechanism since no obvious slip bands were observed during traditional creep-fatigue tests. Andrieu et al.  confirmed that the oxidation-assisted cracking was another reason that should be responsible for the transition of the fracture mode from transgranular to intergranular. According to this, they proposed a crack tip oxidation mechanism consisting of two-stage oxidation concept. Recently, the authors’ previous work  further confirmed that intergranular damage was mainly caused by grain boundary voids in creep-fatigue tests with tensile hold periods. Oxidation damage dominated the creep fatigue tests with compressive hold periods.	0
Few previous life prediction models aiming at this material relied on clear physical meanings and differentiated among different damage mechanisms. Vöse et al.  collected a large database of IN 718 and proposed a unified mechanism-based approach according to the theory of small fatigue crack growth. In detail, the crack initiation lives under LCF, creep-fatigue and thermal-mechanical fatigue (TMF) conditions were determined by integrating crack growth rate, da/dN, until a critical crack length (e.g., 0.4 mm). A linear damage rule was used to describe the summation of fatigue damage, creep damage as well as environmental damage. Finally, a triangle plot provided the relative percentage of the respective damage mechanisms. More recently, Schlesinger et al.  identified different mechanisms of IN 718 under LCF and TMF loading waveforms at elevated temperatures by adopting EBSD technique. After that, time dependent cyclic crack tip opening displacement, ΔCTOD, was used to describe fatigue and environmental damage mechanisms. However, the above-mentioned models were mostly based on the theory of fracture mechanics, instead of which the theory of damage mechanics may be a better method to determine crack initiation lives under complex loading waveforms.	0

A series of rough machining specimens, including cylindrical bar specimens (a diameter of 14 mm and a length of 100 mm) and cubic metallographic specimens (8 × 8 × 8 mm), were taken from the radial forged GH4169 disc by electrical discharge machining wire cutting (wire EDM). All the specimens were solution heated at 960 °C for 1 h followed by air cooled (AC) to room temperature (RT). They were subsequently aged at 720 °C for 8 h, cooled at 50 °C/hr to 620 °C, aged again at 620 °C for another 8 h, and then AC to RT. Main chemical compositions of the heat treated GH4169 superalloy are listed in wt%: 0.034 C; 0.04 Mn; 0.001 S; 0.008 P; 18.91 Cr; 3.00 Mo; 5.01Nb; 0.99 Ti; 0.52 Al; 0.003B; 18.50 Fe; Bal. Ni.	1
The heat treated bar specimens were fine machined for cyclic property tests consisting of LCF and creep-fatigue tests at 650 °C, with detailed dimensions as shown in . After fine polishing the gauge-length areas and confirming the flawless surfaces, the specimens were tested on an INSTRON 8500 servo-hydraulic testing system under strain-controlled fully-reversed loading conditions at a constant strain rate of 4 × 10−3 s−1. Prior to the cyclic tests, the gauge-length area of each specimen was positioned in the middle of the heating furnace at 650 °C for 1 h, for the purpose of ensuring uniform temperature distribution with minimum temperature fluctuation within ±2 °C. The axial strain was monitored and controlled by a high-temperature extensometer during the cyclic tests. According to the ASTM E-2714-13 standard, failure criterion that was manifested as macroscopic crack initiation was referred by a 40% decrease in the cyclic maximum tensile stress within 50 continuous cycles .	1
The testing parameters used in this study are listed in , including four groups of loading waveforms. Specimens F-1 to F-4 in LCF tests followed strain-controlled triangular loading waveforms without creep hold times (abbreviated as 0-0). The remaining specimens in creep-fatigue tests were subjected to three different strain-controlled trapezoidal loading waveforms. Specimens T-1 to T-4 were tested with a dwell time of 300 s at the peak constant tensile strain (abbreviated as 300-0). Specimens C-1 to C-4 were tested with a dwell time of 300 s at the peak constant compressive strain (abbreviated as 0-300). The above-mentioned LCF and creep-fatigue specimens were performed at total strain ranges, Δεt, of 1.0%, 1.2%, 1.6% and 2.0%. In addition, specimens TC-1 to TC-3 were tested with a combination of td and te at a given Δεt of 2.0% (abbreviated as 300-150, 150-300, and 300-300). Within this group, these specimens were helped to elucidate the damage mechanisms and validate the extensive applicability of a modified strain energy density exhaustion (MSEDE) model in tension-compression-hold tests.	1
Cubic metallographic specimens of GH4169 superalloy were conducted in as-polished and etched conditions at RT to reveal the heat treated microstructures and average grain size measurement. In particular, they were wet-ground by using conventional 400, 600, 800, 1200 and 2000 grit carbide papers successively and polished down to 1 μm diamond. Then, they were immersion etched in Nimonic etchant (40mlH2O + 50mlHCl + 10mlHNO3 + 2.5gCuCl2) and finally observed by using optical microscopy (OM). Grain size is measured from five different locations with each area of 500 μm × 500 μm on the basis of linear intercept method .	1
In order to investigate the influence of different loading waveforms on damage mechanisms, a microstructure characterization regards the post-test examinations of the cyclic tests. Fracture appearance observations of specimens F-4, T-4 and C-4 were examined for the typical failure modes under respective loading conditions by using an EVOMA15 scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Subsequently, longitudinal cross sections of all specimens near the fracture appearances were prepared by EDM wire-cutting. Besides the SEM micrographs, high quality electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) Kikuchi patterns and maps were used to observe secondary cracks by using a CamScan Apollo 300 SEM equipped with a Hikari EBSD detector, for the purpose of further investigating the cracking mechanisms under different loading conditions. In order to remove surface residual stress and achieve a good EBSD data, an additional EBSD preparation procedure is introduced here. Otherwise, the resolution rates of EBSD metallographic specimens will be too low to analyze. After grounding through conventional 2000 grit carbides paper, the longitudinal cross sections of the selected specimens F-4, T-4, C-4, TC-1, TC-2, and TC-3 were respectively polished by the following steps: SiC Foil #220 paper at 25 N force for 1 min with water-based diamond suspension, MD-Largo polishing disc at 25 N force for 4 min with DiaPro Allegro/Largo diamond suspension, MD-Dac polishing disc at 20 N force for 3 min with DiaPro Dac diamond suspension, and finally MD-Chem polishing disc at 15 N force for 15 min with oxide polishing suspension (OPS). After the sample preparation stage, Kikuchi patterns were collected by the Hikari detector and EBSD data was processed by Oxford Instruments HKL Channel 5 as well as Tango software.	1
A typical heat treated microstructure among the cubic metallographic specimens of GH4169 superalloy is shown in . The individual grain diameter after heat treatment ranged between 3 μm and 42 μm. The average grain size for GH4169 was measured to be 15.6 ± 1.4 μm. Basic tensile properties of GH4169 alloy at 650 °C after heat treatment are listed in , where σy, σb, e, Ψ, and E denote 0.2% offset yield strength, tensile strength, elongation, percentage reduction of area, and Young’s module, respectively.	0
All the cyclic lives in both LCF and creep-fatigue tests at 650 °C for GH4169 with varying total strain ranges are shown in . The solid line represents the fitted line of LCF life and the dash one for the fitted line of creep-fatigue life with a hold time of 300 s (300-0 and 0-300). Note that LCF and creep-fatigue lives increased with the decreasing of total strain range. Furthermore, the gap between the above-mentioned two fitted lines would continue to widen with decreasing the magnitudes of total strain range, indicating life reduction became more significant at lower total strain range when hold time was fixed. The total length of hold time, td + te, has shown a great impact on its cyclic life as well. In general, the numbers of cycles to failure increased with decreasing the lengths of hold time at the same strain level. For example, specimen F-4 (0-0, Δεt=2.0%) had the highest value of Nf, while the lowest one for specimen TC-4 (300-300, Δεt=2.0%), see . However, the difference between the effects of tensile and compressive hold times on life reduction was relatively small when the length of hold time was kept constant.	0
Fig. 4 displays the cyclic softening curves for GH4169 at 650 °C during the cyclic tests. The curves indicate the relationships between stress amplitudes, Δσ/2, and the numbers of cycles for all the testing specimens. A common process of continuous cyclic softening throughout the fatigue or creep-fatigue lives. In detail, the value of Δσ/2 decreases with increasing loading cycles. Then, a drastic drop of stress amplitude during the last several cycles revealed the occurrence of macroscopic cracking until final failure. For specimens with Δεt=2.0%, they undergo rapid cyclic softening process during almost the whole life and an obvious saturation period is not reached. While for the remaining specimens (Δεt⩽1.6%), saturation state could be noticed after about half of life cycles. In addition, the cyclic softening curves in creep-fatigue specimens with hold periods are close to those in LCF specimens at the same Δεt, see .	0
The cyclic softening ratio , (Δσmax-Δσhalf)/Δσmax, was used to further illustrate the cyclic softening behavior during cyclic tests, in which Δσmax and Δσhalf denoted the maximum stress amplitude and the stress amplitude at half-life cycle, respectively. The relationships between cyclic softening ratio and total strain range under three different loading waveforms (0-0, 300-0, and 0-300) are plotted in a. The three curves revealed highly significant upwards tendency with increasing the total strain range. Moreover, it is worth noting that the three curves are closed to each other, indicating that cyclic softening behavior depended little on hold periods. To make it clearer, the values of cyclic softening ratio under all six loading waveforms (0-0, 300-0, 0-300, 300-150, 150-300 and 300-300) at Δεt=2.0% are plotted in b, where all the magnitudes of cyclic softening ratio lie within a narrow range from 0.15 to 0.18.	0
Fracture appearance observations were used to identify the multiple crack initiation sources as well as the main-crack-failure mechanisms. The fracture appearance observations of specimens F-4 (0-0, Δεt=2.0%), T-4 (300-0, Δεt=2.0%) and C-4 (0-300, Δεt=2.0%) respectively represented the typical ones of those under pure fatigue, tensile hold and compressive hold loading waveforms, as shown in . Among them, three characterized areas could be clearly seen from all the fracture appearances, namely crack initiation, crack propagation and transient fracture zones.	0
b–f illustrated the mainly transgranular mode of initiation of specimens F-4, manifested as relatively smooth fracture appearance near the initiation sources. In such a case, the main crack traversed individual grains without obvious deflection along grain boundaries, whose failure mode is similar to that of IN 718 . A typical transgranular feature of circumferential fatigue striations could be discerned at both crack initiation (b–f) and propagation areas (g). b–f of specimen T-4 showed a certain extent effect of de-cohesion at grain boundaries on the crack initiation sources followed by increased fracture appearance micro-roughness, indicating the transition from transgranular to mixed-mode of initiation. Instead of fatigue striations, a significant feature of secondary crack meandering along grain boundaries has been observed during the propagation stage, see g. This fracture appearance involving grain boundary facets is similar to that of creep-fatigue tests in IN718 at 650 °C . In addition, SEM fractographies of specimen C-4 (a–g) were very similar to that of specimen F-4 (a–g) at both crack initiation and propagation areas. The only difference in the two series of SEM micrographs is that the micro-roughness of fracture appearance was visibly increased in  comparing with that in .	0
The SEM micrographs of secondary cracks in the longitudinal cross sections for specimens T-4(300-0, Δεt=2.0%), C-4(0-300, Δεt=2.0%) and TC-3(300-300, Δεt=2.0%) are shown in a–c, respectively. From a, the linking-up of grain boundary voids can be observed when tensile hold time of 300 s was conducted. A number of δ phase along the grain boundaries were discerned as well. The crack initiates at a transgranular mode possibly due to the presence of oxidized inclusion near the surface, see a. However, after the initial grain, the propagation path tends to be an intergranular mode. Oxidation-induced damage, which can only affect restricted areas including specimen surfaces and crack tips, is nearly impossible to be a main reason for the intergranular cracking mode in a. One evidence is that an overall SEM micrograph of secondary cracks from our previous work  showed that global grain boundary damage including interior areas can be detected everywhere when only tensile hold times are introduced. This kind of grain boundary damage is a typical characterization resulting from the linking-up of grain boundary voids. b revealed that the occurrence of oxidation damage dominated when compressive hold time of 300 s was introduced, where thick oxide layer could also be observed along the crack propagation path until the crack tip zone. Although crack is almost closed during compressive, it doesn’t mean that the oxygen cannot get to the crack tip. The fundamental reason lies in the fact that the presence of tension-going direction (σas>0, where σas denotes applied stress level) makes things different. Auto et al.  reported that oxide always grows in a strain-free condition from the start of compressive hold times, even while the base material experiences compressive stress level. In such a case, oxide film undergoes a large effective deformation that is nearly equal to total strain range in a tension-going direction, which will accelerate oxide rupture process . With crack propagation and cracked oxide scale, the underlying substrate would get exposed to the environment at the crack tip. Subsequently, oxygen would diffuse to the deep along the crack path as well as grain boundaries. After that, new oxide films at crack tips are formed again with the pile-up of oxygen. Several cycles later, dramatic oxide film rupture occurs again and crack propagates further. As a consequence, a repeating process regarding oxidation damage can be obtained, as schematically shown in . Although the formation and linking-up of grain boundary voids almost disappeared, grain boundary embrittlement caused by oxidation damage may promote the oxidation-assisted intergranular crack propagation mode. Combined roles of grain boundary damage and oxidation damage were significantly visible when both tensile and compressive hold times were introduced, resulting in totally intergranular mode of initiation and propagation, see c.	0
In order to further validate the secondary cracking mechanisms under different loading conditions, EBSD micrographs of specimens F-4 (0-0, Δεt=2.0%), T-4 (300-0, Δεt=2.0%), C-4 (0-300, Δεt=2.0%), TC-1 (300-150, Δεt=2.0%), TC-2 (150-300, Δεt=2.0%) and TC-3 (300-300, Δεt=2.0%) were investigated from the longitudinal cross sections as well. EBSD images with recrystallized and deformed fractions under the above-mentioned loading conditions are shown in , where substructured grains are in yellow, recrystallized grains are in blue, and deformed grains are in red. It should be noted that the recrystallized distribution was much less than the unrecrystallized ones in quantity for each image, as seen in . This is due to the fact that apparent recrystallization occurs when the specimens are solution treated at 1000–1170 °C . The deformed grains mainly distributed in the following three zones: (i) on the surface of each specimen, (ii) along the secondary crack path, and (iii) at the tips of grain boundary wedge. The LCF test of specimen F-4 (0-0, Δεt=2.0%) indicated that the deformed areas were concentrated on the surface as well as the crack path, a. b–c illustrated that some interior damage occurred for specimens T-4 (300-0, Δεt=2.0%) and C-4 (0-300, Δεt=2.0%). Increased surface damage and interior damage was visible from d–e of specimens TC-1 (300-150, Δεt=2.0%) and TC-2 (150-300, Δεt=2.0%). It should be noted that some wedging cracks along grain boundaries developed prior to the surface secondary cracks for specimen TC-3 (300-300, Δεt=2.0%), as shown in f. In addition, tensile hold time was inclined to lead to interior damage that was far away from specimen surface and crack path, especially when we compared b and c or d and e.	0
It is recognized that the EBSD technique can well differentiate between random high angle grain boundaries (HAGBs) and coincident site lattice boundaries (CSLBs) on the basis of Brandon’s criterion . The symbol “Σ” for a certain CSLB is defined as the reciprocal of the fraction of coincident atomic sites between two grains at the grain boundary (i.e., Σ3 represents a grain boundary having one third of coincident sites) . In the cases of GH4169 and some other FCC Ni-based metals, Σ3 CSLBs dominate all the other low-value CSLBs and play an important role in the resistance of cyclic deformation, embrittlement cracking and intergranular oxidation .	0
a shows the inverse pole figure (IPF) map of secondary cracks in the longitudinal cross section for specimen TC-3 (300-300, Δεt=2.0%). The grain boundary map with Σ3 CSLBs highlighted by red lines is illustrated in b, where the majority of the Σ3 CSLBs are rendered as twin boundaries. As it can be seen, the cracks were likely to bypass the Σ3 CSLBs during propagation stage, as indicated by several positions in b. Furthermore, positions 1 and 2 indicated that crack tips chose to propagate through “triple junctions” which intersected two Σ3 CSLBs with different directions, rather than through Σ3 CSLBs themselves, see b. Statistical data analysis was conducted in this study for the secondary cracks of all the 15 testing specimens (). Quantitative characterization showed that over 80% of secondary cracks chose to keep away from Σ3 CSLBs during propagation stages. This phenomenon may be due to the subsequent two reasons.	0
Firstly, cracks caused by cyclic strain localization and stress concentration usually take place on {111} slip planes with high Schmid factors . Noting that the triple junction of each position that was close to Σ3 CSLBs (b) was located at the crack tip, and the angles between the loading direction and the normal of each crack tip were measured as 38° and 42°, respectively. Thus, each triple junction surrounded by the Σ3 CSLBs was oriented on a critical plane with nearly maximum resolvable shear stress . Secondly, the outstretched boundaries of triple junctions were manifested as the HAGBs. Random HAGBs are usually regarded as barriers to the dislocation movement from one grain to another because of their disordered structures , as schematically shown in a. Dislocation sliding will be inhibited along the HAGBs due to their incoherent site lattice, and then the accumulated pile-up of dislocations increases with increasing loading cycles. Finally, once the crack tip encounters the outstretched HAGBs, it can lead to an easier crack propagation path with consuming less energy. On the contrary, low-value CSLBs, in particular for Σ3 CSLBs, are not effective in resisting penetration by moving dislocations due to their coincident site lattice and aligned edges , as schematically shown in b. Besides, crack tips will be strongly blocked when in contact with Σ3 CSLBs due to their special performances of low total interfacial energy, little segregation of strengthening alloying elements and low intergranular oxidation .	0
Quantitative characterization on the distributions of secondary cracks for all the 15 testing specimens is illustrated in . LCF specimens F-1 to F-4 () with Δεt ranging from 1.0% to 2.0% are shown in a. Note that the surface secondary crack density tends to be 2 mm−1 when Δεt⩾1.2%. Surface secondary crack density is defined as the ratio of observed numbers of secondary cracks along surface edges and the lengths of surface edges. The proportion of intergranular cracking initiation decreases with increasing the magnitudes of Δεt. Once Δεt reached 2.0%, all surface secondary cracks initiated at a transgranular mode. The remaining creep-fatigue specimens () with Δεt ranging from 1.0% to 2.0% under three different groups of trapezoidal loading waveforms are shown in b. For specimens T-1 to T-4 and specimens C-1 to T-4, surface secondary crack density increased with Δεt, and more than 40% of the surface secondary cracks initiated at an intergranular mode. When specimens TC-1 to TC-3 () under more complicated loading waveforms were introduced, both the surface secondary crack density and proportion of intergranular cracking initiation were much higher than those for specimens T-4 and C-4, respectively.	0
There exists three competitive/combined cracking modes in pure fatigue damage process at elevated temperatures: (i) time-independent cracks developing along the slip bands, (ii) time-independent cracks growing on the free surface, and (iii) time-dependent cracks developing along grain boundaries . Instead of slip band cracks and grain boundary cracks, damage process in the LCF regime is mainly controlled by time-independent surface cracks, since the cracks along slip bands and grain boundaries are almost invisible, as seen in a. This may result from low repetitive extrusions and intrusions as well as relatively short exposure time at high temperatures. The single-factor driving force in LCF tests limits surface secondary crack density of each specimen (less than 2 mm−1, a). In such a case, surface secondary crack density is only determined by the degree of cyclic plastic deformation. In addition, at higher total strain ranges (Δεt⩾1.2%), surface secondary cracks of each specimen are always inclined to concentrated in the specific area near the fracture appearance, indicating high crack propagation rates of the main crack. Therefore, the values of surface secondary crack density will not increase with higher strain levels, which agree well with the tendency in a.	0
Combined cracking modes of surface cracking and grain boundary damage greatly affect the distributions of secondary cracks in creep-fatigue tests . This phenomenon can also be observed in this study, see b–f. In creep-fatigue tests with tensile hold periods, several additional potential factors are supposed to increase the possibilities for cracking, including significant oxidized inclusions (a) , precipitate-assist micro-voids , grain boundary voids caused by the coalesce of cavities (f) , and outstretched HAGBs of triple junctions (b) . It should be noted that oxidized inclusions as well as some surface cracks resulting from cyclic plastic deformation may produce transgranular cracking initiation mode, while the remaining factors (i.e., precipitate-assist micro-voids, grain boundary voids and HAGBs) may be responsible for intergranular cracking initiation mode. In compressive hold periods, the tendency of surface secondary crack density with varying total strain ranges (blue solid fitted lines and data points in b) is very similar to that of LCF tests in a. This is due to the fact that oxide layer formed on the surface of each specimen with compressive hold period can be regarded as a weak barrier that can be easily dominated by cyclic plastic deformation . However, some differences still exist in surface cracking initiation mode (red dash fitted lines and data points in b). In detail, some surface secondary cracks initiated as a transgranular mode especially at high Δεt, the effects of oxidation and grain boundaries embrittlement would further change surface crack initiation into an intergranular mode. The motivation of this kind of intergranular mode in compressive hold periods is quite different from those in tensile ones (b). Under this circumstances, localized slip-band-impinged micro-cracks which are attributed to oxidation-assisted effect may become a driving force for micro-cracks along grain boundaries .	0
In order to make a connection between mechanical properties and damage mechanisms under various loading waveforms, it is necessary to establish a theoretical model that can address both effects of creep and oxidation on fatigue life reduction. In a previous work , a MSEDE model was developed used in creep-fatigue tests with tensile hold periods and those with compressive hold periods (i.e., specimens T-1 to T-4 and C-1 to C-4, ). The aim of this section is to validate the extensive applicability of the model to creep-fatigue tests involving both tensile and compressive hold periods (i.e., specimens TC-1 to TC-3, ).	0
The proposed model is based on the combinations of linear damage summation (LDS) framework and energy dissipation criterion (EDC). Two main advantages can be achieved: (i) LDS framework has been widely applied for assessing fatigue and creep damage separately and the model constants can be easily obtained from LCF and pure creep tests , (ii) EDC can successfully describe the influences of different damage mechanisms on creep-fatigue lifetime, including cyclic plastic deformation, grain boundary voids, and oxidation-assisted mechanisms . In the LDS framework, it is well known that simple summation of competition damages per cycle is calculated to predict the numbers of cycles to failure under different strain-controlled loading waveforms.	0
Fatigue damage per cycle, df, which is generally due to cyclic plastic deformation and the subsequent fatigue striations (i.e., b–g), can be presented aswhere σmax and Δεp are the maximum stress and plastic strain range at half lifecycles, and a1 and b1 are model constants. It is noteworthy that the term of σmax·Δεp denotes tensile hysteretic energy, according to Ostergren’s damage function . It should be noted that the term 1/df is equal to Npf, where Npf denotes pure fatigue lifecycle at a certain strain level.	0
Creep damage per cycle for creep-fatigue tests with tensile hold periods, dc, which is due to interior damage along grain boundaries (i.e., a and b), can be determined from a continuous integral function. Moreover, some recent works on creep-fatigue life assessments  regarded the strain energy density as a dominated damage parameter controlled the creep damage during stress relaxation periods, i.e.,where ẇcreep is the instantaneous creep strain energy density rate, wf is the creep strain energy density accumulated at failure, and wf,crit(T) is the critical creep failure strain energy density at a certain temperature. In our previous works , the evaluation of dc considered the mean stress effect, stress relaxation rate and the final expression of creep damage. However, for GH4169 superalloy at 650 °C, the magnitudes of mean stress are very low (less than ±15 MPa) and mean stress effect can be ignored due to tiny stress drops during stress relaxation periods . In such a case, the final form of Eq.  can be presented aswherewhere φC and n1 are model constants in the power-law equation of wf, A and B are model constants in stress relaxation equation.	0
Another interesting attention should be paid to the oxidation damage within creep-fatigue tests with compressive hold periods , which can also be found in b–c. The first role of oxidation is to exacerbate the surface cracking mode resulting from cyclic plastic deformation, the damage mechanism of which is similar to that in LCF tests (b–g and b). The second one is to embrittle the grain boundaries and produce some localized slip-band-impinged micro-cracks . Under this circumstance, a phenomenological deterioration factor, α, based on fatigue damage is proposed, i.e.,where λO and n2 are model constants in a power-law equation of α, Nf-o is the experimental fatigue-oxidation endurances in compression-hold-only cases, and the term Nf-o·te is the accumulated exposure time in compressive hold periods. Similar to the transition time proposed in Andrieu’s work , Eq.  describes a two-stage process of α during compressive hold times, which is consistent with our previous suggested mechanism controlled by oxidation . In brief, the matrix material is free from oxidation in the first stage due to the presence of compact oxide film of Cr2O3. In the second stage, crack initiation incubation period caused by cyclic plastic deformation accelerates due to worse high temperature performance of oxide film as compared to the matrix. Furthermore, oxygen diffusion and penetration would lead to the grain boundaries embrittlement.	0
According to this, oxidation damage per cycle, do, based on fatigue damage in compressive hold case can be presented asA series of life prediction equations can be expressed with respect to three different loading waveforms, i.e.,where Nc-fT denotes the predicted creep-fatigue life for tests with tensile hold periods, Nf-oC denotes the predicted fatigue-oxidation life for tests with compressive hold periods, and Nc-f-oTC denotes the predicted creep-fatigue-oxidation life for tests with both tensile and compressive hold periods.	0
Nine modeling parameters used in the proposed MSEDE approach are listed in . The procedures for fitting these parameters are illustrated as follows:	0
Fatigue: The constants of a1 and b1 are determined by fitting fatigue data of specimens F-1 to F-4 at half lifecycles. The magnitudes of a1 and b1 are linearly fitted by log(σmax·Δεp) vs. log(Npf) line in natural coordinate system.	0
Creep: Three constants of φC, n1 and wf,crit are obtained from uniaxial pure creep tests at different stress levels, whose values are the same to those from our previous work . Similarly, the magnitudes of φC and n1 are linearly fitted by log(ẇcreep) vs. log(wf) line in natural coordinate system. Note that the value of wf,crit is regarded as an upper bound limit here. On the basis of MATLAB GUI Development Kit (MGDK), another two constants A and B are determined from experimental data during stress relaxation periods. Fitting stress relaxation curves of specimens T-1 and T-4, which are set as examples, are shown in .	0
Oxidation: Deterioration factor of α can be defined as a ratio of pure fatigue life and compression-hold life at the same strain level, based on the transformation of Eq. . The magnitudes of λO and n2 are linearly fitted by log(Nf-o·te) vs. log(α) line in natural coordinate system.	0
Then,  shows the prediction capabilities of the proposed model aiming at complicated strain-controlled modes. In general, it gives relatively accurate predictions within an error band of ±2. However, the predicted lives seem to be overestimated than the experimental ones when both tensile and compressive hold times are introduced, see . This may be due to the fact that nonlinear interactions among three competition damages (df, dc, and do) are not considered by using simple LDS rule.	0
Vöse et al.  developed a triangle plot that provided respective damage contributions due to fatigue, creep and oxidation. a shows the relative percentages of the three damage mechanisms by combinations of MSEDE model and Vöse’s damage diagram, whose values can be determined by the following equations, i.e.,where Nf is the experimental number of cycles to failure, the term DX=∑i=1NfdX(i)(X=f,c,o) denotes accumulated damage for each type, and the term PX(X=f,c,o) denotes respective relative percentage of the total damage for each type. For tension-hold tests and compression-hold tests, higher relative amount of fatigue damage can be identified with increasing the values of Δεt. As for tension-compression-hold tests, a combined influence of fatigue, creep and oxidation can be observed. This trend is consistent with the secondary cracking observation in c. However, fatigue damage dominates all three damage mechanisms because all of them are conducted at a high strain level (Δεt=2.0%). It should be noted that extreme insignificant amount of creep damage for specimen TC-2 can be observed, whose data point is nearly located at the base line of triangle, see a. The root cause of this lies in the fact that the presence of wf,crit determines a critical hold time, tcrit, in a certain loading condition. A maximum value of ẇcreep can be obtained at the start of hold period, and it decreases with increasing the hold time due to stress relaxation. Thus, the magnitudes of φCẇcreepn1 are always higher than wf,crit within the length of tcrit, leading to a zero value of creep damage. The calculated tcrit is equal to 139 s for specimen TC-2, which indicates that the effective hold time producing creep damage is 11 s remaining.	0
Although the triangle plot is suitable for observing the contributions of three different competition damages intuitively, nonlinear design codes cannot be implemented here. The purpose in this section is to use an extensive three dimensional (3D) damage interaction plot containing an additional nonlinear design code. Distributions of accumulated creep, fatigue and oxidation damage for all the validated data points can be shown in b. For specimens T-1 to T-4 sustaining creep-fatigue damage, the data points are located at XOY plane. Similarly, the data points of specimens C-1 to C-4, whose failure mode is dominated by fatigue-oxidation damage, are located at XOZ plane.	0
Besides, by following the design line of Dcn+Dfn=1 for describing the tradition two dimensional creep-fatigue plot , a simplified continuous enveloping surface can be expressed bywhere n=0.576 is the power exponent in the simplified continuous enveloping surface, indicating that a specimen experiences the most serious nonlinear damage when DX≈0.15(X=f,c,o).	0
It can be seen from b that all the 11 experimental data are located within an error surface of ±1.5. Another advantage of the proposed 3D plot is that flexible design codes can be selected based on different materials at elevated temperatures. An in-deep study of nonlinear design codes will be investigated in our further work.	0
LCF and creep-fatigue behaviors in Ni-based GH4169 alloy at 650 °C were systemically studied by strain-controlled fully-reversed loading waveforms. Four groups of testing specimens with total strain ranges from 1.0% to 2.0% were tested to investigate hold time effect on life reduction, cyclic softening behaviors, main-crack-failure modes, special performances on Σ3 coincidence site lattice boundaries cracking mode and damage mechanisms. A generalized life prediction model has been further verified to build a connection between macroscopic mechanical properties and microscopic damage mechanisms. The conclusions are as follows:	0
The effects of tensile and compressive hold times on life reduction are significant, particular at low total strain ranges. The tests involving both tensile and compressive hold periods are more damaging than those having only tensile or compressive hold period.	0
A common process of continuous cyclic softening is experienced throughout the fatigue or creep-fatigue life. Cyclic softening ratio increases significantly with total strain range, which depends little on hold periods.	0
Quantitative characterization on the distributions of secondary cracks shows that different loading waveforms lead to different damage mechanisms. Fatigue damage dominates LCF tests even at a high temperature of 650 °C. For the hold times under tension only, the linking-up of voids is responsible for the intergranular damage. While local oxidation damage should account for the occurrence of intergranular damage under compression only.	0
By the considerations of linear damage summation framework and energy dissipation criterion, a generalized life model shows reasonable prediction results within an error band of ±2. It can well model the combined effects of fatigue, creep and oxidation under complex strain-controlled loading waveforms.	0

Superalloys play an important role in the industries wherein high working temperatures are challenges for the service life of more common alloys. The alloy Fe–28Ni–13Cr is an iron-base high nickel superalloy which is widely used in gas turbines, jet engines and other similar applications. Working at high temperatures and constant stresses has motivated some researches on the possibility of creep in this alloy [1,2]. Although, the severe working conditions of such alloys usually draws more attention to the failure mechanisms during service, their appropriate high temperature processing and shaping is another challenge.	0
It is generally accepted that the hot workability of alloys decreases as their alloy content increases. Alloying elements often interact with the restoration mechanisms of dynamic recovery (DRV) or dynamic recrystallization (DRX) through making fine precipitates or exerting a solute drag force on the moving boundaries. On the other hand, the occurrence of DRV or DRX is essential to avoid strain accumulation and to assure a stable flow during hot deformation. Therefore, the higher alloy content, the less efficient restoration processes which manifests the need for the exact design of hot deformation regime in order to avoid any flow instability.	0
It has been well documented that DRX is the dominant restoration mechanism of materials with low and medium stacking fault energy (SFE) such as austenite in steels [3–9]. On the other hand, DRV occurs expeditiously during the hot deformation of high SFE materials such as aluminum or ferrite [10–12]. Alloying elements have a strong impact on the SFE value and thereby the softening mechanism is effectively influenced. For instance, nickel is characterized by a SFE value as high as 128mJ/m2[13] and is therefore supposed to increase the average SFE value of the austenite phase in an iron-base superalloy. Hence, nickel theoretically increases the tendency to DRV. On the other hand, previous researchers have claimed that in some high SFE materials such as ferrite, extensive DRV may lead to the initiation of new grains, which is so-called continuous DRX (CDRX). CDRX that occurs after a prolonged DRV is different from the classic form of dynamic recrystallization, which is generally known as the discontinuous DRX (DDRX). It is evident that the strain value that is needed to accomplish DDRX or CDRX should be different and therefore, having in-depth knowledge about the softening mechanism is essential to the proper design of hot deformation regime. Regarding this, Ebrahimi et al. [14] investigated the hot deformation behavior of a Ni–Cu alloy (70Ni–30Cu) and indicated that the mechanism of DRX is sensitive to the deformation regime. At high temperatures and low strain rates, DRV could progress towards a CDRX process, whereas at low temperature and high strain rates DDRX was responsible for flow softening. This is not in complete agreement with the current perception about the occurrence of DDRX in austenite with the mechanism of strain induced grain boundary migration [15]. It is supposed that nickel is responsible for changing the mechanism of softening from DDRX to CDRX. However, this idea needs to be more analyzed and fortified in different high nickel alloys. Hence, the current research aimed to examine the mechanical behavior and microstructural mechanisms involved in the hot deformation of a high nickel superalloy steel.	0
The material used in this investigation was Fe–28Ni–13Cr superalloy steel with the chemical composition according to Table 1. The ingot of this alloy was prepared by casting and homogenization and thereafter was hot rolled to the final microstructure illustrated in Fig. 1. Cylindrical compression samples of 12mm height and 8mm diameter were prepared according to the ASTM E209 standard with the axis along the rolling direction of the strip. Graphite powder was applied to the contacting surfaces to reduce the friction coefficient and to minimize the sample barreling. An INSTRON 8502 testing machine equipped with a fully digital and computerized control furnace was employed to perform hot compression tests at strain rates ranging from 10−3s−1 to 1s−1 and at temperatures of 950–1100°C. In order to eliminate temperature gradients before testing, the specimens were held 10min at any deformation temperature. The raw data of load-stroke were corrected for the influence of deformation heating and friction using the methods proposed by Evans and Scharning [16] and Zhao [17], respectively.	1
After hot compression tests, the specimens were cooled within 3s and cut along their longitudinal axes. The samples were prepared by the standard techniques, etched via waterless Kalling’s reagent (100mL ethanol, 100mL HCl, 5g CuCl2) and then characterized by an optical microscope.	0
Fig. 2 indicates the representative corrected flow curves at different deformation conditions. Taking a general look, almost all the flow curves of different conditions are typical of DRX. DRX is considered as the major microstructural phenomena when the flow curve indicates either a broad or a sharp peak after which the flow stress descends gradually or rapidly. However, different apparent characteristics of the flow curves is directly related to the different mechanisms of microstructural evolution. In the obtained flow curves, except for the high strain rate of 1s−1, including both high and low temperatures, a broad peak is observed suggesting a difference in the mechanism of DRX at low and high strain rates. The observed difference should be more addressed by mechanical and microstructural examinations.	1
Different constitutive equations are often used to correlate the flow stress of a given material to the applied strain rates and temperatures. Theses equations are often used to model the hot deformation behavior or to generalize the laboratory data to the industrial hot working processes. The more common constitutive equation in hot working is that proposed by Sellars and Tegart in a hyperbolic sine form as follows [18]:where α, n and A are material constants and Z is the Zener–Hollomon parameter that incorporates the strain rate and temperature as follows:It has been experimentally proved that at some specific conditions of low or high flow stresses, Eq. (1) is changed to a power-law or an exponential form equation, respectively, as given below [19]:where n′, β , A′ and A″ are material constants. In order to determine the appropriate constitutive model for a given material, the constitutive form of flow stress can be draw versus the reciprocal of temperature at constant strain rates. In the first step, one can take natural logarithm from Eqs. (1), (3), and (4) as follows:Fig. 3 illustrates the variation of flow stress with 1/T at a given strain of 0.5 and constant strain rates. It is apparently seen that the hyperbolic sine equation better accomodates the experimental data. The appropriateness of each constitutive model is assessed by the value of correlation factor (R2) summarized in Tables 2–4. As observed, the average value of correlation factor (Ravg2) for the hyperbolic sine function is higher than those of the power-law and exponential equations.	0
Referring to Eq. (5) that was taken as the constitutive equation for the studied material, the value of n could be determined by drawing ln {sinh(ασ)} versus strain rate at a given strain and deformation temperature. Since, Eq. (5) is differentiated as follows:Therefore, in Fig. 4, the average value of the slopes gives the value of 4.0678 for n at typical strain of 0.5. It should be noted that the value of α is often determined by try and error so that to bring the lines in Fig. 4 to the most parallel condition. Here, the best value of this parameter that satisfied the experimental results was 0.0088.	0
The apparent activation energy for hot deformation can be determined by differentiating ln {sinh(ασ)} with respect to 1/T in Eq. (5), as follows:The partial differential term in Eq. (9) refers to the average slope of the curves plotted in Fig. 3c that was determined about 12257.3. Therefore, the average value of Q at strain of 0.5 is calculated as 414kJ/mol that relatively agrees with the value of 483kJ/mol reported by Ducki et al. [20]. As the last step, the value of A can be determined from the following equation that has been derived from Eq. (1):As indicated in Fig. 5, the intercept in the plot of ln Z versus ln {sinh(ασ)} gives the average value of A as 3.512×1014. The procedure described through Eqs. (8)–(10) was repeated for strains of 0.1 to 0.5 and the average values of n, Q and A were determined as summarized in Table 5. The data populated in Table 5 can be used to estimate the value of flow stress at any given strain, strain rate and deformation temperature and is so applicable to the industrial design of working forces.	0
As mentioned, the different flow behaviors of the material at low and high temperatures are potentially attributed to a change in the mechanism of microstructural evolution. If one looks over the position of the peak point, the change in flow behavior is clearly observed. Fig. 6 indicates the variation of the peak strain with strain rate at different temperatures. The peak strain (εp) is important because it is the point at which DRX actually commences. It is expected that εp increases with increasing strain rate and decreasing temperature [21]. Whereas, the present results indicate that at all studied deformation temperatures εp increases as strain rate is augmented up to 0.01s−1 and further decreases unexpectedly at higher strain rates. This anomalous behavior can be hypothesized to be resulted from a change in the mechanism of DRX from a continuous nature at lower strain rates to a discontinuous one at higher strain rates. The continuous dynamic recrystallization (CDRX) comes after a prolonged or extended DRV. Through this process, the new recrystallized grains are originated from the growing subgrains. Due to the vast recovery before recrystallization, the flow curve of CDRX seems to be between a flat curve associated with a pure DRV and a pure DDRX curve characterized by a clear peak point. Therefore, a faint peak that is observed at low strain rates is attributable to the typical flow curve of CDRX. On the other hand, DDRX starts with the mechanism of strain induced grain boundary migration (SIBM). Before this step, DRV is negligible, giving rise to the build-up of dislocation density till SIBM starts. This process proceeds until a layer of new grains covers the grain boundaries and forms a so-called necklace structure. The flow curve corresponding to DDRX almost possesses a clear peak at which the necklace structure is completed and causes a discernible decrease in flow stress. However, at high strain rates and low temperatures, the rate of DRX declines and the peak almost becomes less clear.	0
According to this discussion, if DDRX was the dominant mechanism, it would be expected to observe more pronounced peaks at low strain rates of 0.001s−1 and 0.01s−1 than the peak at 1s−1. However, the results corroborated this idea that the mechanism of DRX has been CDRX at low strain rates, i.e. below 0.1s−1, and DDRX at high strain rates, i.e. higher than 1s−1.	0
The microstructures of the deformed samples were characterized in order to examine the suppositions came from the mechanical testing. Fig. 7 illustrates the microstructures at constant strain rate of 0.001s−1 and different temperatures. Although the corresponding flow curves were typical of DRX, but all the microstructures contains wavy grain boundaries more discernible at higher temperatures. Ebrahimi et al. observed similar microstructures in a hot deformed monel 400 and ascribed it to CDRX [14]. The serrations over the boundaries have been attributed to the tensions due to the subgrains that formed during extended DRV [22,23]. The serrations become more distinguished as strain further increases and the volumes surrounded by the wavy boundaries are introduced as new CDRX grains. Some of these new grains are indicated by arrows on Fig. 7d. It is also worth noting that CDRX grains are different in shape from the traditional equiaxed grains that are formed through DDRX.	0
Since extended DRV is a prerequisite for CDRX, it is more expected in high SFE materials such as ferritic stainless steels and aluminum. In the present material high Ni content seems to be responsible for increasing the SFE value and thereby CDRX may be the outcome at low strain rates. On the other hand, in Fig. 8 that demonstrates the microstructures obtained at 1s−1 the equaxic grains are a sign of DDRX. Different microstructural features evidently shows that the mechanisms of DRX at low and high strain rates are different. Although, at lower temperatures DRX has not been completed yet, but very small grains has formed a necklace structure typical of DDRX. Fig. 9 shows the microstructure obtained at 950°C and 1s−1 magnified to demonstrate the necklace structure of new equiaxed grains at prior grain boundaries that has been pointed by arrows. The change in the mechanism of DRX can be also understood by observing the variation of apparent activation energy with the value of strain. This approach has been also used to describe the origin of deformation mechanism in the microstructural response of the material [24]. In many different alloys, Q obeys an adverse dependence on strain. At low strains, Q indicates a high value of energy imposed on the workpiece to start plastic deformation. By increasing strain and beginning flow softening due to DRV and further by DRX, Q decreases. In the studied material, the expeditious DRV that starts at low strains needs low activation energy, while with increasing strain and further joining of DRV with DRX, Q increases (Fig. 10). This is due to the fact that the movement of high angle boundaries in DDRX or low angle boundaries in CDRX requires higher activation energy than DRV. The border for this change in the behavior of DRX is determined as the strain rate of 0.01s−1 indicated by Fig. 6.	0
The hot deformation behavior of A286 iron-base superalloy was analyzed using mechanical testing and microstructural observations. The most important results are listed as follows:	0
The flow curves of the material over the studied temperatures and strain rates are typical of dynamic recrystallization.	0
The relation between flow stress, deformation temperature and strain rate was examined via power-law, hyperbolic sine and exponential constitutive equations and the hyperbolic sine function was found more appropriate.	0
The peak strain increased with strain rate up to 0.01s−1 and further decreased at higher strain rates suggesting a change in the mechanism of dynamic recrystallization from a continuous to a discontinuous nature.	0
Microstructure of the hot deformed samples at low strain rates was characterized by wavy boundaries typical of continuous dynamic recrystallization. On the contrary, at high strain rates fully equiaxic grain structure reflected the occurrence of discontinuous dynamic recrystallization.	0
Tool wear is an important factor which affects the machined surface characteristics. During the manufacturing processes, machined part surfaces get more or less destroyed depending on the cutting forces caused by worn tools. Larger cutting forces generate poor surface finish as well as extensive surface damage [1]. This destruction is decisive for the later characteristics of the manufactured part such as sliding, lubricating, corrosion resistance, contact, fatigue, fracture and straightness properties. Tool wear estimation is therefore not only a diagnostics requirement to prevent machine-tool failure and production-material waste, but also plays crucial role which mainly affects the dimensional integrity, better performance and service-life of machined components.	0
Unfortunately, there is no direct way to measure tool wear without interrupting the machining process. CNC operators usually decide the tool wear level off-line via visual inspection of cutting edges or on-line with sound level related to their experience. Today’s modern unmanned CNC manufacturing machines require robust on-line tool condition monitoring systems. In-process tool condition monitoring (TCM) system is an approach to indirectly detect the tool wear level in machining. High sensitive sensor equipments integrated to machine tools together with an efficient mathematical model are necessary for a robust on-line tool wear monitoring system.	0
A general TCM system development stage is divided into four main phases; (1) the planning phase (design of experiment), (2) application phase, (3) data acquisition and signal processing phase, and (4) analysis phase. For the planning and application phase, utilization of different sensors has been reported in on-line TCM research area such as, dynamometer, accelerometer, motor load current, acoustics emission, temperature, optical and sensor fusion techniques. However, most of these on-line TCM techniques have been conducted on lathes which use non-rotating single tools [2–16]. In milling however, tool wear progression is different as the cutting edge enters and exits the workpiece repeatedly throughout the process. In addition, rotating motion of milling cutters makes it difficult to attach the sensors close to the cutter-work-piece interface [17]. TCM systems, developed for turning processes, are therefore not guaranteed to work satisfactorily for a semi-intermitted process like grinding or a fully intermitted process like milling [18]. Recently some researchers have developed TCM systems using various sensors and different wear estimation techniques for milling. Ghosh et al. [18] used cutting forces, spindle vibration, spindle current, and sound pressure level for ANN based flank wear estimation. Iqbal et al. developed an in-process fuzzy expert flank wear monitoring system based on measured peak values of two components of force signals (Fx and Fy) using a dynamometer [19]. Tseng and Chou proposed a rule based tool monitoring system for end milling, based on spindle motor current [20].	0
The objective of this work is to develop a robust TCM system for end milling of Inconel 718. Inconel 718, as a difficult-to-cut superalloy, is widely used in aerospace and gas turbine industries. It is especially used in aircraft engine parts, high-speed airframe parts such as wheels, valves, buckets, spacers, and high temperature bolts and fasteners in severe operation conditions. With such a robust on-line tool condition monitoring system, especially companies that have long production runs with difficult-to-cut superalloys such as Inconel 718 on their machining centers, an efficient tool maintenance (changing inserts or worn tools) can be accomplished. Since the sudden failure of the worn cutting tool deteriorates the machining surface, it is possible to obtain a certain surface quality with an accurate prediction of tool wear.	0
The current paper presents evaluation of cutting conditions on tool life and proposes an effective hybrid strategy to estimate tool flank wear while milling of Inconel 718 superalloy. In this proposed strategy, three axis cutting force, torque, cutting conditions and cutting time data are combined with measured tool flank wear data to create an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. The ANN model is then verified with measured data. Using this ANN model, an online tool tracking system is developed for monitoring the flank wear of the main cutting edge. The system indicates whether tools are performing efficiently or are not.	0
Taguchi’s orthogonal array structure offers robust experimental design with decreased experiment number. Taguchi method involves analysis between the factors, their interactions and responses. The method is widely used in engineering applications. Taguchi’s orthogonal array structure was used for experimental design, as reduced number of experiments can be acceptable for industry. A standard Taguchi orthogonal array L9 (33) was chosen for the most controlled factors such as, cutting speed (Vc), Feed per tooth (Sz) and Depth of cut (Doc). Radial depth of cut factor was kept at a constant value of 1mm during the experiments because material removal rate can be controlled with depth of cut factor. Three levels of milling process factors were selected according to tool manufacturer’s recommendations as given in Table 1.	0
In this study, superalloy Inconel 718 was used for experiments. Several studies have been done by the researchers for investigating the effects of changing operating parameters on the tool life, productivity and tool wear patterns obtained when machining of Inconel 718 [21–26]. Table 2 shows the chemical composition of Inconel 718 having an average hardness of 40 Rc used in this experiment. The material was initially machined for a rectangular block shape of 70×62×70mm. Sandvik inserts (R390-11 T3 08M-PL 1030) mounted on (R390-016A16-11L) cutter body with 16mm diameter was chosen for experimental cuts at dry cutting conditions.	0
The milling tests were conducted on five axis rotary table type Deckel-Maho DMU 60P CNC machining center. Planar and down-milling type CAM strategy was generated by using ProEngineer Wildfire PLM software to automate each experiment. The rotating cutting force dynamometer (Kistler Corporation, Model 9123C1111) is used for the dynamic and quasistatic measurement of the three force components (Fx, Fy, Fz) as well as of the drive moment Mz on a rotating tool. The rotating cutting force type dynamometer (RCD) has advantages over fixed dynamometers, such as the cutting forces can be measured on the rotating tool independently of the size of workpiece and measurement can be performed on any spatial position (four or five axis milling). The cutter body was mounted with a single insert on RCD. The tool cutting edge is aligned with RCD’s zero count groove on the principal Y axis of the RCD dynamometer. The output from the cutting dynamometer is transferred with a non-contact Radio Frequency protocol to charge amplifier (Kistler Corporation, Model 5223B). Fig. 1 shows the machine tool, workpiece and RCD setup for experimental study.	1
Nine experiments have been carried out at different cutting conditions according to Taguchie’s orthogonal array design as given in Table 3.	0
Three cutting force components (Fx, Fy, Fz) on principle axis directions and torque data were collected differentially using NI 6229 multifunction PCI data acquisition card together with NI BNC 2110 connection block. Required data acquisition software was written by using MATLAB DAQ toolbox v2.9 [27] and data acquired with 15 KSample/s sampling rate. The cutting process was interrupted at different time intervals depending on the performed cutting condition and wear propagation. There are several types of tool wear damages observed at the tool tip during the experiments. Crater, chipping, notching and flank wear are the observed wear mechanisms. Generally the end of tool life is determined by the excessive wear at the tool flank face. Maximum wear length at the flank face of the tool was measured as wear land by using Nikon Eclipse L150 microscope at 50× magnification and ImageJ software [28] according to ISO 8688-2 throughout the whole of the machining tests. The measurement of flank wear for a sample is shown in Fig. 2. The maximum flank wear criteria for each insert were assigned to be approximately 500μm.	1
Collected signals shown in Fig. 3 have to be processed in order to develop an online TCM system. The cutting force and torque signals acquired after each interrupting cut was processed with RMS, which is the most common statistical feature extraction method as:where n represents the total number of data in each cut as indicated in Fig. 3. For identification of online TCM system overall 170 wear stages were measured in nine different experiments.	0
Nine experiments have been carried out at different cutting conditions according to Taguchie’s orthogonal array design, as given in Table 1. Fig. 4 shows, tool flank wear (VB) measurements plotted against time for each of nine experiments.	0
All the graphs shown in Fig. 4a–i indicate a gradual increase of the flank wear with progressive time. In general, low (0.3mm) and medium level (0.45mm) of depth of cut (Doc) values generates strong linear trend between cutting time and gradually increased tool flank wear. Results show that the development of the flank tool wear was relatively rapid in the level of 0.6mm depth of cut.	0
The main effects of Signal to Noise ratio (SNR) for the tool life are shown in Fig. 5. Maximum level of cutting speeds and depth of cut (Doc) give faster removal rates but also produce fast excessive edge cratering and flank wear. The minimum tool life for the maximum values of the cutting conditions shown in Fig. 4a is 5.76min. Fig. 5 shows that minimum level of cutting conditions (Vc=50m/min, Sz=0.06mm/rev, Doc=0.3mm) will give the maximum tool life according to Taguchi analysis.	0
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) for tool life represents the evaluation of the effects of cutting conditions as given in Table 3. In Table 4, P-values test the statistical significance of each of the factors. Since none of the P-values are less than 0.1, the factors have no statistically significant effect on tool life even at the 90.0% confidence level. However, it is observed from the ANOVA table that depth of cut and cutting speed have more influence on the tool life than feed rate.	0
Figs. 6–8ac show various graphs of tool flank wear plotted against cutting forces and torque for depth of cuts of 0.6–0.45mm and 0.3mm at different cutting conditions respectively.	0
Figs. 6–8 show that, cutting forces and torque have an upward trend while tool wear increases. The cutting forces, particularly the axial cutting force component Fz and the torque (Mz), decreased gradually as shown in Fig. 6a–c, as the flank wear progressed. This is for another wear mechanism, the crater wear, which affects the cutting forces and torque. Growths in crater wear causes cutting forces and torque to decrease. The reason for this is the increase in effective rake angle 16 due to the crater wear. It was observed however that, this decreasing trend of the cutting forces and torque was not long. For a larger form of the crater and flank wear, effective rake angle decreased 16. As a result cutting forces and torque increased again to previous levels with rapid tool wear propagation.	0
Torque (Mz) and Fz components of RCD dynamometer signals are more sensitive to tool flank wear as compared with Fx and Fy signals as indicated in Figs. 6a–c to 8a–c. However it is difficult to decide which signals is actually more important on estimating tool wear. Therefore, for analyzing influence of tool flank wear propagation on cutting forces (Fx, Fy, Fz) and torque (Mz) linear regression analysis was completed on the data plotted in Figs. 6a–c to 8a–c.	0
Multiple regression models were developed for each cutting experiments. The aim of the regression models presented in Table 5 is only for extracting the sensitivity information which analyses effect of flank wear propagation on cutting forces and torque.	0
Cutting forces and torque were used as independent (predictor) variables and maximum flank wear as dependent variable to perform regression models. Table 5 includes the multiple regression models, model correlations and P-values for the analyses of the effect of the cutting forces and torque on maximum flank wear.	0
The multiple regression models are determined by using the Statgraphics [29] statistical analysis software. Results of analyses of variance for the maximum flank wear (VBmax) regression models supported strong linear relationship (at 95% confidence level) between the variables in the models since model P-values less than 0.05 (Table 5). Minimum P-values belong to cutting forces (Fx, Fy, Fz) and torque (Mz) are shown in bold In Table 4 which indicate the highest relationship between flank wear. According to distribution intensity of P-value results, particularly torque signal Mz but also tangential cutting force Fy and axial force component Fz have significant effect on determination of progressive flank wear.	0
The actual power and advantage of neural networks lies in their capability to represent both linear and non-linear relationships and in their ability to learn these relationships directly from the data being modeled. Conventional linear models can be insufficient when it comes to modeling data that contains non-linear characteristics. For this reason, an ANN model has been developed for estimating the flank wear of the tool to take the advantage of the neural networks in this study.	0
ANN is a mapping method between input and output data based on simulation of biological nervous system, such as the brain, on a computer. It was introduced by McCulloch and co-workers in the early 1940 [30]. Its non-linear mapping architecture produces high flexibility for modeling a system. As a result, ANN has become one of most popular technique used for analyzing the problem without the need to understand its theoretical complexities. This feature of the ANNs is very useful in some circumstance where it is hard to derive a mathematical model. Tool wear considered in this study is very complicated process associated with several parameters. Therefore, ANN is an appropriate technique for developing TCM systems only using experimental samples acquired from metal cutting operations.	0
An ANN has multilayer architectures consist of massively interconnected processing nodes known as neurons. In the network, each neuron accepts a weighted set of inputs and first forms the sum of the weighted inputs with a bias defined by [31]where P and wi are the number of elements and the weights of the input data xi. The bias for the neuron is given by b. The knowledge is stored in the neuron as a bias and a set of weights. Then, the neuron responds with an output. To this end, the sum of the weighted inputs with a bias is processed through an activation function, represented by f, and the output that it computes is	0
The neuron model emulates the biological neuron that fires when significantly excited, i.e. the neuron’s input, n, is large enough. There are many ways to define the activation function such as threshold function, sigmoid function and hyperbolic tangent function.	0
Using an appropriate learning method, ANNs are trained to perform a particular function by adjusting the values of the connections, i.e. weighting coefficients, between the processing nodes. The training process continues until the network outputs converge to the target. The difference between the network output and the desired output is minimized by modifying the weights and biases. When the difference is below a pre-determined value or the maximum number of approximations is exceeded, the training process is ended. This trained network model can be used to simulate the system outputs for the inputs that have not been introduced before.	0
The structure of an ANN is usually composed of three parts: an input layer, hidden layers and an output layer. The data contained in the input layer is transformed to the output layer using the hidden layers. Each neuron can receive its input only from the neurons of the lower layer and send its output only to the neurons on the higher layer.	0
For development of a TCM system, the total number of 170 wear stages was measured in nine experiments. In order to implement an ANN model, data was divided into two sets namely the training and test sets. For training phase of ANN model, randomly selected 85% of data set was assigned as the training set (145 observations), and the remaining 15% (25 observations) was employed for testing the performance of the network.	0
The architecture of the ANN for the TCM system, along with its input and output parameters, is illustrated in Fig. 9. The inputs for the ANN model are the cutting conditions, cutting time, RMS values of cutting forces and torque. The output from the ANN is the flank wear. Cutting conditions in the input vector of the ANN model were obtained from the Cutter Location Data (CLDATA) file which was generated by using ProEngineer Wildfire PLM software. The cutting time information was extracted from the difference between the data acquisition start and stop trigger for each cutting pass.	0
The performance of an ANN is influenced by the characteristics of the network such as the number of hidden layers and the number of nodes in each hidden layer. Since there are no definite methods to determine the optimal number of hidden layers and the neurons on each layer, a significant amount of time during the design of the ANN model is spent on the selection of appropriate variables for network architecture by heuristic search.	0
The activation (transfer) function in the hidden layer is another important factor influencing the network performance. There are several ways to define the activation function, such as a tangent hyperbolic, logarithmic or a threshold function. For the developed network, a hyperbolic tangent sigmoid function was chosen as activation function in this study as below:	0
The input and output data were initially transformed to be in the interval of [−1,1] using the following equation:where pn is the transformed form of the data p.	0
Consequently, by trial and error with different ANN configurations, an optimal, custom designed ANN architecture was found with using MATLAB Neural Network Toolbox. The training data set that is selected randomly, was used to train the network until it gives an approximate function between the input and output parameters. The predictions of the output parameter (VBpre) were performed using a three layer feed forward ANN with using a back propagation (BP) which is the most popular technique for supervised training of neural networks. BP minimizes an error function, i.e., a mean squared error that is the difference between the actual network output vector and the desired output. An iterative gradient descent technique is used to adjust the weights. The ANN model was trained with four training variations of back propagation methods: Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb and Shanno (BFGS) quasi-Newton training method, gradient descent back propagation, and resilient back propagation and Levenberg–Marquardt. Among them, the Levenberg–Marquardt training method provided the best performance; and therefore, was used to adjust the weighting coefficients for ANN model.	0
As illustrated in Fig. 9 developed ANN model consist of an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer. The number of neurons in the input and output layers are equal to the number of the input and output parameters, respectively. The hidden layer has 12 neurons for ANN architecture.	0
Table 6 shows the test data set, which consists of, input parameters of ANN and the actual and predicted output parameter (VBpre).	0
The performance of the ANN based prediction was assessed by a regression analysis between the network output, i.e. predicted parameters, and the corresponding targets, i.e. experimental values. The criteria used for measuring the network performance are the correlation coefficient, mean relative error and absolute fraction of variance, R2.	0
The correlation coefficient assesses the robustness of the relationship between the predicted and experimental results. The coefficient between the actual and predicted outputs is calculated by [32]where Cov(a,p) is the covariance between the a and p sets that refer to the actual (experimental) output and predicted output sets, respectively, and is defined by [32]where E is the expected value, μa is the mean value of the set a and μp is the mean value of the set p. If the Cov(a,p)=0, then a and p are expected to be uncorrelated. Similarly, Cov(a,a) and Cov(p,p) are the auto covariances of the a and p sets, and are given by	0
The correlation coefficient ranges between −1 and +1. r Values near to +1 indicate a stronger positive linear relationship, while r values near to −1 indicate a stronger negative relationship. The mean relative error, which is the mean ratio between the errors and the experimental values, can be calculated from	0
For the multiple regression analysis a statistical indicator namely the absolute fraction of variance, R2, can be used	0
R2 ranges between 0 and 1. R2 value of near 1 shows a very good fit, however near to 0 gives a poor fit.	0
The predictions of the trained ANN for the performance parameters are given in Fig. 10. The predicted versus target values for the selected 25 flank wear (VBmax) measurements are shown. Fig. 10 is provided with a straight line indicates a perfect prediction also within an error band of ±10%. This is related to the accuracy of the ANN predictions. As shown in Fig. 10, the ANN predictions for the flank wear yielded a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.992, a mean relative error (MRE) of 5.42% and an absolute fraction of variance (R2) of 0.996 with the experimental data. These values show that the ANN predicts the flank wear (VBmax) reliably.	0
Fig. 10 also shows that, only one predicted flank wear out of randomly selected 25 wear cases remain outside the ±10% error band. As a result, the figure demonstrates a quite satisfactory agreement between the predicted and target values of tool flank wear for developed TCM strategy. The predicted versus observed flank wear values in different experiments for evaluating the ANN performance illustrated in Fig. 11, as well.	0
A neural network based flank wear monitoring system was developed and presented under changing cutting conditions for milling of Inconel 718. ANN model uses cutting conditions, cutting time, buffered real time cutting force and torque data. The network was developed using the data acquired for 170 operations from nine experiments.	0
According to experimental results, it was observed that torque is an important signal which is not used in most of the TCM system development literature for milling operations. It has been shown from regression equations, Mz signals are most indicative for the flank wear progression than tangential cutting forces (Fx, Fy). The relationship between tool wear propagation and cutting forces-torque variation can also be used for the development of effective tool condition monitoring strategies.	0
It was observed that cutting forces and torque signals are both sensitive to cutting conditions. However, during the experiments for some cases the cutting forces and torque reduced with the effect of crater wear development. To model this complicated event and enhance the prediction accuracy for robust tool condition monitoring system a hybrid approach was used by employing cutting conditions and cutting time.	0
The trained ANN model was tested at 25 different cutting conditions and cutting time intervals. The presented ANN model demonstrated a very good statistical performance with a high correlation of 0.992 between the actual and predicted values for flank wear. The proposed TCM strategy using a rotating cutting force type dynamometer (RCD), can be implemented to complex five axis machining operations e.g. impeller machining.	0

Nowadays, the world still faces the critical challenge of providing abundant, cheap electricity to meet the needs of a growing global population, while at the same time preserving environmental values becoming a more and more crucial problem . Because of the low cost and wide availability, coal is still one of the most dominant energy sources for electricity generation and extensively used in thermal power plants. Increasing the temperature and pressure of the working steam is a good way to improve the efficiency and reduce the emission. But these increases cause much more serious service conditions for boiler heating surface. Inside and outside the steam generation tube, the high temperature and pressure of the supercritical vapor and flames make the heating surface extremely vulnerable to the working condition . Under this condition, creep deformation (bulging), fracture (longitudinal rupture) and high temperature corrosion could take place with serious consequences. Actually, the leakage and rupture of boiler tubes in power plants is a serious problem that can lead to unscheduled and costly outages. The predominant failure location of current concern is circumferential cracking on the fireside of water wall tubes of a boiler .	0
To protect the boiler water walls from failure, many researchers have done plenty of work to investigate the working status of heating surfaces. Some scholars investigated and tried to improve the combustion conditions within the furnace to create a better working condition for the heating surface (mostly water walls) . Other scholars researched the high temperature corrosion behaviors of boiler heating surface materials . And recently the effect of stresses which is unavoidable during the boiler operation was further investigated . But the detail situation of stress distribution on heating surfaces was not well investigated. Since the heat flux entering steam generating tubes in power station boilers is a critical factor in considering the safety of the tubes , there are some literature concerning the temperature and heat flux of the boiler (water walls), but most of them were done by the simulation work and were partially analyzed . A systematic experimental exploration of the working conditions (temperature/T, heat flux/q, strain/δ and stress/σ distribution) of boiler water walls under boiler operation was not well performed, especially the strain and stress information, which is really hard to obtain considering the high temperature situation. However, since so many boiler accidents were caused by the deformation and fracture of the water walls , it is really necessary to gain some understanding of strain and stress conditions when the boiler under operation.	0
In the present paper, the temperature and local heat flux of furnace membrane water walls were well measured under two different combustion conditions: one symmetry combustion condition with all 16 burners in operation, and the other asymmetry condition with the left 8 burners running. Also, the corresponding strain and stress distributions were also firstly obtained on a laboratory scale opposite wall-fired furnace.	0
The experiments were conducted in a wall-fired boiler in our laboratory, as showed in . Eight steel plates (2mm in thickness) and seven steel tubes (φ12×2mm) welding together one by one to develop each membrane wall. Then, four water walls are assembled by pin connections to form the furnace chamber. The cross section of the furnace is 0.32m (width x)×0.32m (depth y), the height z of the furnace is 1.35m. Overall, sixteen swirl burners are installed on the front and rear walls to realize the opposite wall firing. The heights of the lower and upper burners are 0.21m and 0.33m. The burner is designed using the staging supply air combustion technology, with 3 hierarchical airs: a primary air with the supply of fuels, a swirled inner second air and a straight out second air. The cooling water is pumped into the water walls from the bottom upward to the top, and then goes back to the cooling tank. Considering the combustion stability and safety, we use natural gas instead of pulverized coal to do the experiment.	1
 shows the arrangements of the temperature and strain/stress measurement points on the furnace. The temperatures of the cooling water and front, right and rear membrane walls were measured using T-type and K-type thermocouples respectively. We also analyzed the strain and stress of the water walls using three-dimensional strain rosette to gain both the magnitude and direction. Wall temperature points were just corresponding to the strain and stress measurement points. Some temperature measurement points were also arranged to gain some information about the temperature of the flue gas and inner furnace wall. Considering the complexity of the experimental measurement, we chose one wall (the left wall) to represent the working state of the two side walls. There were totally 118 water temperature and 60 wall temperature measurement points and also 60 strain and stress measurement points.	0
The local heat flux of the water wall is represented by the steady-state energy absorption of the cooling water. The water temperature is kept below the boiling point to keep the single-phase heat transfer status. Therefore, after getting the temperature increase of the cooling water, we can calculate the heat flux q (kW/m2) in each heating region:where m is the mass transport rate of the cooling water (kg/s), cp is the specific heat capacity of the water (kJ·kg−1·K−1), ΔT is the cooling water temperature increment during each heat transfer region (K), and A is the corresponding area (m2).	0
For the strain and stress measurement, because of the unknown direction, we use the three-dimensional strain rosette (0, 45, 90°) to gain both their magnitude and direction. After obtaining the strain of these 3 rosette (ε0, ε45, ε90), the number and orientation of the main strain and stress can be decided as:	0
Main strain:	0
Main stress:	0
The angle of the stress:where ε0, ε45, ε90 are the three strains gained by the 3 strain gages, 0°, 45° and 90°, separately. E and μ are the Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio of the water wall material.	0
To make it more applicable, we use the dimensionless relative position and relative value to present the results. The relative height, width, and depth are defined aswhere x, y, and z are the actual values in the Cartesian coordinate system and a (=0.32m) is the equivalent spherical diameter of the furnace chamber.	0
The relative heat flux, strain and stress are defined as the ratios of their local value with the average value of the water walls, to reflect the spatial distribution feature.where V represents the relative value. vij is the measured variables and va is the average value of the variable. Subscripts i and j denote the height direction and tube index on the furnace water wall.	0
To measure the deviation degree of the data, the coefficient of variation (Cv) was defined as the ratio of the standard deviation (σ) to the mean value (μ).	0
The uncertainties in the combustion conditions due to fuel quality, environmental temperature and pressure were negligible. Rotameters that used to measure the fuel, primary, and secondary air streams were made by ZYIA with maximum values of 4.0L/min, 10L/min and 4.0m3/h, and scale divisions of 0.2L/min, 1L/min and 0.2m3/h, respectively. For the combustion state variables measured, the uncertainty caused by the fuel and air input should be considered. Since there were 4 and 8 separately working burners, with the rated fuel flow rate of 2.11L/min, the fuel input error, which was the most important uncertainty source underlying in combustion, was less than 2.5% based on flow rate and measurement accuracy.	1
For the temperature measurement, both the K-type thermocouple for gas temperature and T-type for water temperature were manufactured using Omega thermocouple wires. Rated uncertainty of these devices as reported by the manufacturers is <1%. The data collection utilized an IMP 35951C data collection system, which the manufacturers do not provide an uncertainty value for, but should be negligible compared to other error sources. For the strain and stress measurements, the strain gages used were AVIC BAB120 high temperature gages, with a gage factor of 1%. There should be some additional error caused during the welding process of the gages. But the zero calibration performed each time before collecting strain and stress data should counter these errors and reduce the uncertainties back to ∼1%. The strain gage for the strain and stress data measurement was a DH3821 by Donghua Testing Technology Co. LTD, with a rated accuracy of 0.1%.	1
Another major source of uncertainty lay in the heat transfer process during the steady state experimental condition. Restricted by the rated temperature limits of the strain gage, thermal insulation material was not utilized to keep the boiler walls from atmospheric conditions. Thus, heat transfer was occurring during the experiment. Although we tried to keep the surrounding environment temperature uniform, this heat transfer part was not always constant, which resulted in some extent of experimental error, less than 5% for the full load condition based on the estimated temperature calculation.	0
Combining these relative terms gives the total uncertainty for the measurement of temperature, heat flux, strain and stress. During these experimental conditions, the errors caused by the measurement instruments were relatively small. It is the manufacture, the combustion itself and the heat transfer process that accounted for the uncertainty. As discussed above, taking all the error sources accumulated, the maximum uncertainty here was less than 10%, which was sufficient for industry guidance. To help mitigate this error, measurements shown in the following sections are averaged from multiple experiments.	0
The working state of the furnace water wall system was experimentally measured under two conditions: the full load symmetry combustion condition and the left half load asymmetry combustion condition. The reason why we chose the left half load asymmetry condition is that our measurement points were set on the left wall other than the right wall. To investigate the effect of the asymmetry combustion, we tried to find the running state change of the water walls while maintaining the left part of the boiler under similar combustion condition.	0
Under full load, when all the 16 burners are under running, the combustion condition in the furnace chamber is symmetry. The working status of the furnace water walls is shown in the following figures.	0
 presents the temperature distribution of the water walls under full load condition. As we can see in the picture, the temperature on the left wall is much higher than those on the front and rear wall. A high temperature zone was found just above the burner levels on the left wall, while at and above the same height, a relatively low temperature zone was detected in the middle of the front and rear wall. This was reasonable. In the furnace chamber, 8 pairs of opposite flames from the 16 burners on the front and rear wall, encountered with each other in the middle of the chamber and spread out in all directions. On the left and right direction, the high temperature flames reached the left and right wall, which made the high temperature zone of these two walls appeared, and the edge sides of the front and rear wall, as well. Limited to the small space in the lower direction of the furnace, little flame went down to the bottom of the furnace. While on the contrary, most of the flame went up to the large chamber space in the upper direction, which could be demonstrated by the relatively high temperature on the entire left wall. Since the flames went straightly forward to the middle of the furnace after getting out of the burner, there was little flame stayed near the waist of the front and rear wall, which resulted in the lower temperature zones on the front and rear wall. Still, we could find some flame went back to the walls on the upper side. What’s more, due to the existence of the furnace arch on the rear wall, the average temperature on the rear wall was a little higher than the front wall.	0
The relative heat flux distribution of the furnace water walls under full load symmetry combustion condition is disclosed in . The average heat flux under this condition was 49.5W/m2. Similar to the temperature distribution of the furnace, the heat flux on the left wall was also much higher than those on the front and rear wall, and there was an obvious high heat flux zone. Unlike the high temperature zone mostly distributed in the middle part of the furnace, the high heat flux zones were mostly located in the bottom of the furnace, which was exactly where the burners set. Even though the heat flux on the left wall was much higher, there were high heat flux areas on every wall. And all the heat flux of the upper parts of the three walls are relatively small. All these similarities and differences showed that the heat flux distribution of the furnace water walls have some but not decisive relationship with the temperature distribution, which revealed that the heat transfer in the furnace chamber was mostly determined by means of heat radiation other than convectiveheattransfer. One thing should be mention is that, since we use the natural gas instead of pulverized coal as fuel, the influence of the properties of the coated ash, which played an important role in real power plants , was not involved here.	0
 shows the strain and stress distribution of the furnace walls when all burners under working. This is really something of great value, considering litter information was given on the systematic measurement of the strain and stress distribution of the entire heating surface. For the strain, with an average value 173.6μm, as we can tell in the figure, it is much higher on the left wall than that on the front wall and rear wall. An extremely high strain value area was detected in the middle left of the left wall. Centered with this high point, the strain of the left decreasingly spread out. What should be pointed out is, unlike the temperature and heat flux distribution, the strain distributions on the front wall were quite different from those on the rear wall. The front wall seemed divided into a left high deformation part and a right less deform part, while on the rear wall, the high strain was distributed much complex, like in a big “V” zone. This was really interesting, since the temperature and heat flux distribution on these two walls were really similar. What’s more, although with its high values also on the left wall, the detail high strain value zone was quite different from those of the high temperature and heat flux zone. The high heat flux area was mostly in the bottom of the furnace where combustion located and heat radiation was intense. The high temperature zone was almost there and a little upper. With the flame formed and went up in the furnace, it reached the left and right wall. But for the high strain and stress zone, it seemed located just in the high temperature zone on the left wall, but not exactly. On the front and rear wall, the connections between the high strain area and high temperature zone became less.	0
A reasonable explanation for this is that the distributions of strain and stress do have some relationship with the temperature distribution, but not definitely determined by it. During the manufactory of the furnace, i.e., the water walls and other heating surfaces, some fixed joints were needed in order to keep the furnace as a whole. Unlike the temperature and heat flux distribution, the strain and stress distribution of the entire water wall system were strongly affected by these fixed constraints. It is the effects of both temperature distribution and these fixed joints that determined the strain and stress distribution of the boiler heating surface. At higher temperature, like on the left wall, the influence of temperature seemed like more important.	0
The stress which water wall material suffered was greatly related to the deformation of the material. A larger deformation means a higher stress the material suffering. Therefore, from the length of the stresses in the figure, we can tell that the stresses have almost the same distribution with the strain. The average stress was about 0.161MPa. As for the direction of the stress, we could tell the stresses on the left wall were mainly horizontal, while the stresses on the rear wall were mostly in the vertical direction. Usually, the limitation from the water tubes made stresses along the tube direction to a small magnitude. But the furnace arch on the rear wall to some extent gave the space for the wall to extend in the vertical direction.	0
After obtaining the temperature, heat flux, strain and stress distribution of the water walls under full load combustion condition, we gained an overall understanding of the working status of the water wall systems under symmetry combustion condition. But for some asymmetry combustion situations, we assume that the working state of the water walls may become even worse. Therefore, we set a particular asymmetry combustion condition, with the 8 burners on the left side of the chamber working, to explore the working status of the water walls.	0
 shows the temperature distribution of the water walls under the asymmetry combustion condition. Similar to the full load condition, temperature on the left wall was much higher than those on the front and rear wall. Also, a higher temperature zone was found just on the upper side of the burner level. Although the overall temperature was lower than that under full load combustion condition, the temperature on the left wall and the left side of the front and rear wall was kept high. The big difference lay in the right part of the furnace. From the low temperature of the right side of the front and rear wall, we could tell the temperature on the right wall was definitely lower. This difference in the temperature distributions, especially the big temperature difference on the right and left side of the front and rear wall, may have some different influence on the strain and stress distribution of the furnace water walls.	0
With an average value of 25.1W/m2, the relative heat flux distributions of the furnace water walls under this particular asymmetry combustion condition are presented in . Since the heat flux was mostly dominated by the means of radiation heat transfer, the higher heat flux area was located on the bottom of the water walls, where combustion happened. Compared to the full load symmetry combustion condition, the heat flux on the left wall here was lower, and not so much higher than that on the front and rear wall. As for the heat flux on the front and rear wall, they both showed an asymmetry distribution between the right and left side, presenting much higher heat flux on the burning burner side. With only the left 8 burners working, which means half part of the furnace chamber filled with flames, there was ample space for the flame to transport into. We could consume a relatively free spreading blaze, which resulted in much more random heat flux distributions on the upper direction of the front and rear wall.	0
 displays the strain and stress distribution of the furnace water walls under this asymmetry combustion condition. Unlike the asymmetry combustion condition, and the asymmetry temperature and heat flux distributions on the front and rear water walls it resulted in, the strain and stress distribution on these two walls seemed much more uniform. The average strain and stress value under this condition was about 140.0μm and 0.140MPa. Compared to the full load condition, the small strain area was smaller on the front wall, and the overall strain on the rear wall became larger. The magnitude of the stresses on both front and rear walls became larger, while their directions kept almost the same direction. This showed us that with the larger temperature and heat flux distribution differences on the front and rear walls caused by the asymmetry combustion, both the strain and stresses of these two wall became larger. Temperature and heat flux, mostly temperature distribution did have great effect on the strain and stress distribution. But it didn’t mean a higher temperature area resulted to a larger strain and stress zone, which the results definitely demonstrated. The relatively constant direction of the stress suggested that in the real situation, the fixed constraints had given the strain and stress distributions a preset trend to follow.	0
Just like the full load symmetry combustion condition, the deformation and stress distributions on the left wall showed more about the temperature distribution, higher temperature zones corresponding to larger strain and stress area. To some extent, we can infer that a relatively more homogeneous and higher temperature distribution could have a much greater influence on the strain and stress distribution. This was easy to understand, higher temperature definitely had a larger effect on the deformation of the material, which made the effect of the fixed joints became relatively less. And a uniform temperature distribution cause less arbitrary deformation, which also helped to present the influence of temperature. One thing need to pay attention was, although the magnitude of the stress here on the left wall was more or less similar to those under full load, the directions of some big stress points were almost inverse. This showed the integrality of the whole water wall system. The strain and stress changes on the front and rear wall also had an important impact on the deformation and stress distribution of the left wall. The regular direction change of the influence implied this kind of impact also in a way of integrality.	0
The following tables indicate the reduced data under full load symmetry and half load asymmetry combustion conditions. Because of the different heat load and combustion arrangement, the running states of the water wall under the two conditions definitely present lots of differences, even though the left part of the boiler was under almost same flame condition.	0
From the data comparison of , we can tell that, in spite of the asymmetry combustion condition, all the parameters including the strain and stress under half heat load condition were comparatively less than those under full load. Deviation coefficients of the distributions were under the same level. For the heat flux, the averaged value showed nearly the same ratio of the heat load 2:1. The temperature and strain distribution of the water walls revealed similar kind of the load influence. This gave some evidence of the influence of the temperature distribution on the deformation of the water walls. For the stress, the ratio was a little bit smaller, which meant that the stress under the asymmetry combustion condition was relatively larger, and the maximum value under the asymmetry condition was even higher than that under full symmetry load condition.	0
 presents more detail information about the running condition of each water wall. Despite the similar flame condition on the left side, it seemed that the right part of the boiler flame also had great impact on the left wall. The average wall temperature and heat flux decreased when it came from the full load to the left half load, and the strain and stress declined even more obvious. It suggested that under uniform flame condition, the heat load which determined the wall temperature and heat flux distribution also have great impact on the strain and stress. A lower heat load which meant lower wall temperature and heat flux could result in an even less strain and stress level. As for the front and rear wall, the wall temperature and heat flux also present similar change to the left wall, decreased a lot with the combustion condition change. However, the strain and stress were different, they declined a little and kept at a similar standard. The stress of the front wall even became larger, which was resulted from the influence of the asymmetry combustion condition. With lower temperature and heat flux level, the front and rear walls should have lower stress standard, but it became even larger in practice, which meant the asymmetry combustion condition really aggravated the stress distribution.	0
The temperature, heat flux, strain and stress distributions of the furnace water walls under full load symmetry and an asymmetry combustion condition were experimentally investigated to gain some basic understanding of the heat transfer and deformation of the boiler heating surface. Some conclusions are shown below:	0
Temperature distribution of the water walls directly related to the distance of the flame. Areas that contacted with the flames present high temperature.	0
Heat flux distribution was dominated by the heat load and radiation. The temperature of the flame played a more important role. The high heat flux zone was always at the burner level of the furnace.	0
The strain and stress distribution of the heating surface was affected by both the temperature distribution and fixed constraints. Fixed constraints determined the basic trend of the deformation, while temperature influent the detail magnitude and direction.	0
Heat load dominated the overall wall temperature and heat flux standard, and thus, the strain/stress level on uniform flame condition. The asymmetry combustion condition did have great promotion impact on the stress of the water wall.	0

Superalloys, which are regarded as high-temperature materials, are used in the components for gas turbine engines and heat exchangers. They display unique resistance to mechanical and chemical degradation over extended periods of time at elevated temperatures . However the lifetime of these superalloys is strongly dependent upon and limited by their microstructural characteristics . The microstructure of a typical nickel-base superalloy consists of γ channel (the fcc structure) and γ′ precipitates (the L12 structure). Defects such as vacancies, dislocations, stacking faults and twins can occur in this γ/γ′ structure when subjected to tensile and compressive tests, which strongly influence the mechanical properties of the superalloys . As one of these defects, deformation twins play a pivotal role in the strength and ductility of the superalloy. In a γ′ strengthened Fe-based superalloy, deformation twins occur at intermediate temperature, leading to an improvement of strength and ductility, but abundance of twins at high temperature lead to a degradation of strength and ductility . The relevant microstructural interactive effects refer to the relationship between dislocations and twin boundaries.	0
The twin-dislocation and twin–twin interactions in fcc structure were investigated and the conclusions were made as follows: (1) twin–twin interactions are accomplished by secondary twinning at the intersection , (2) dislocations can propagate across the existing twin boundaries under appropriate geometrical conditions  or dissociate in order to relax stress concentration . Recently twin intersections were studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation, and their configurations depended strongly on temperature and applied stress . A geometrical restrictive condition for a deformation twin to pass through another one and form a secondary twin at the intersection was put forward . Generally speaking, different opinions were mentioned about twin-dislocation and twin–twin interactions in fcc structure.	0
Most of the previous work on the twin-dislocation and twin–twin interactions has been focused on the common fcc structure . In nickel-base superalloys, most researches have involved in the mechanism of twinning nucleation, ignoring the process of twin propagation . In this work, growth characteristics of twins in a TMS-82 superalloy during thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) cycling are investigated with the aid of TEM observations. The evolution of twin-dislocation and twin–twin interactions at different stages of TMF cycling is discussed.	0
A nickel-base single crystal TMS-82 superalloy was chosen for this work. The nominal composition of this alloy in weight percent is given in . The alloy was solution heat treated both at 1300°C for 1h and 1320°C for 5h followed by a two-stage aging process at 1150°C for 4h and 870°C for 20h. The volume fraction of a the γ′ phase is about 60% and the average size of the γ′ cuboids is 0.4μm. The specimens were machined from cast bars with their longitudinal axis paralleling to the [001] direction. Cylindrical specimens for TMF tests with a gauge length of 135mm and a diameter of 6mm were prepared by mechanical machining and grinding.	1
TMF tests were carried out on a MTS 810 servo-hydraulic TMF machine with a capacity of ±50kN. To simulate the actual conditions of blades and vanes, the following experimental conditions were chosen ((a) and (b)): temperature range, 400°C⇔900°C in air; total strain range, ɛt=1.28% (±0.64%); frequency, (0.1+th) (h)/cycle, where th=1h was the hold time at the maximum testing temperature (900°C); wave form, trapezoidal; phase, out-of-phase. During the hold time of 1h at the maximum compression strain, there was a stress relaxation process. Then the TMF test gradually proceeded from compression to tension. A tensile plastic deformation was present around 400°C on the top of the curve ((c)).	1
The microstructures of all fatigue-tested specimens were obtained with the aid of a JEOL 2000 FX II transmission electron microscope (TEM). Foils for TEM observation were obtained by cutting 0.3mm thick discs perpendicular to the tensile axis of the TMF-tested specimens using a low speed diamond saw. They were mechanically thinned to 40–50μm and then electropolished using a solution of 10% perchloric acid in methanol at −20°C. All TEM micrographs were imaged under two-beam conditions: dark field and bright field. After TMF failure, the observation for the deformed microstructures was carried out by using a JEOL JSM-6060 scanning electron microscope (SEM).	1
 shows the microstructure of an interrupted specimen after the second stress relaxation of the TMF cycling. One can see that the γ′ precipitates are embedded in the γ phase uniformly and there are rare dislocations in the γ/γ′ structure of TMS-82 superalloy. Thin and straight twin plates, which originated from γ/γ′ interfaces as demonstrated in (a), propagate homogeneously through γ channel and γ′ precipitates without any disturbance or interruption. In this case, the true thickness of twins varies from 40nm to 80nm. After 30cycles, more and more dislocations have been introduced and the deformation twin tends to appear with a larger size, as shown in . The twin plate is thick at one end and thin at the other end, which means that the twin is growing. The thickness of the thick end is about 120nm. It is well known that a twin can propagate by the movement of partial dislocations in their twinning {111} planes. As indicated by arrows, several steps exist along the twin boundary. Existence of a step can be rationalized by the blocking of tangled dislocations for the movement of partial dislocations.	0
Based on TEM observations, a lot of dislocations can be found in a specimen which was interrupted after TMF failure. There exist interactions in varying degrees between a growing twin plate and the pre-existing dislocations, as shown in . In this micrograph, dislocations are mainly distributed in γ/channel, which means that this specimen ruptured just after the hold time during compression and before the tensile plastic deformation. Most dislocations in γ′ phases disappeared due to annealing and rarely new dislocations occurred. Thus, it seems that there are relatively less dislocations. The twin plate typically consists of three different parts: a grown part (A), a growing part (B), and a stopped part (C). Here a grown part means that the twin plate has propagated through this area without any obvious hindrance from the existing dislocations. That is to say, this part of the twin plate grew in the early stage of TMF cycling when there were few dislocations tangled in γ channel. The tapering section (B) of the twin plate means that this part is growing with the slip of twinning partials, which is similar with the situation in  to some extent. It is very interesting to note that one part (C) of the twin is stopped there, as shown in . The tangled dislocations, which were generated during TMF cycling, greatly impeded the growth of part C.	0
After TEM analysis, these lattice dislocations can be determined to have a Burgers vector of 1/2〈110〉. For the two-phase γ/γ′ structure of typical superalloys, twinning dislocations, which have a Burgers vector of 1/6〈112〉, may slip on the successive {111} planes to form a twin . That is to say, a twin plate in superalloys arises as a consequence of consecutive movement of twinning dislocations, as shown in (a). This growth mode is common when there are few dislocations in the specimen (e.g., the propagation of the twins in ). The twinning dislocations can move smoothly, bringing about a straight twin plate with constant width. With TMF cycling going on, more and more lattice dislocations are generated, which can not react with the twinning dislocations. The tangled dislocations can act as an obstacle to twinning dislocation motion in varying degrees, as shown in (b) and (c).	0
In addition, it is possible for a twin to release some perfect dislocations and this can bring down the energy of a propagating twin in fcc structure . This process can take place under the condition that the stress field is large enough, for example, the presence of dislocation pile-up groups. It is suggested that twinning dislocations may produce other dislocations when they slip to tangled dislocations, which causes a growing twin to terminate. From the morphology of twin plates in TMS-82 superalloy after TMF cycling, this kind of specific reaction has not been observed so far. However, it is postulated that the morphology of twins is influenced by the pre-existing tangled dislocations.	0
 shows an interesting interaction between the dislocations and the twin plate. Although there exist large numbers of dislocations, it is difficult to find the evidence such as steps or termination shown in , to confirm the hindrance of tangled dislocations for a growing twin. It is suggested that the twin plate has grown up before more and more dislocations are introduced around the twin.	0
The TEM observation revealed that during the tensile plastic deformation stage of the TMF cycling, a large amount of dislocations were produced. And after the subsequent hold time (1h as described in ) in compression at 900°C, most of the dislocations disappeared due to annealing, leaving few dislocations in the specimen. However, the twinning process, which may occur and continue during the whole TMF cycling, tends to be effected by the presence of dislocations. If the twinning process happens during or just after tensile plastic deformation with large amounts of dislocations, twin propagation will be hindered or stopped by these pre-existing dislocations (). On the other hand, if twinning process occurs at the primary stage of the TMF cycling or just after the hold time with few dislocations in the specimen, the twinning dislocations will propagate straight and smoothly. The dislocations which are introduced subsequently after the next tensile plastic deformation can not change the morphology of the pre-existing twin ().	0
In practice, the twin–twin interaction refers to the interaction between a propagating twin and a pre-existing twin. In a similar way to twin-dislocation interactions, a propagating twin (or accurately speaking, its twinning dislocations) may be hindered or be stopped by a pre-existing twin on the basis of lots of experimental observations. According to statistical data of more than ten SEM images, twin–twin intersections exhibit a remarkable characteristic: the number of twins stopped by pre-existing twins is much larger than that of the twins which can totally or partly pass through the pre-existing twins.  shows intersection characteristics of deformation twins after TMF fracture. The interrupted twins are marked by arrows. The areas inside the circles stand for intersections of the propagating twins and the pre-existing ones. It should be noted that the propagating twins can pass through the pre-existing twins (or called impeding twins) smoothly without changing their directions. That is to say, the twinning dislocations of propagating twins do not react with or form other twinning or perfect dislocations when getting to the pre-existing twins . Thus the twin–twin interactions in TMS-82 superalloy are not involved in formation of the secondary twins. In some cases, the propagating twins tend to become thinner and thinner after intersecting.	0
 shows the complex intersections of twin–twin interactions during TMF cycling. From the morphology, it is postulated that the twin A is a pre-existing one and the twins B and C are growing toward the twin A. The thickness of twin A is about 100nm. It is very interesting to note that the twin B can pass through the block twin A partly and the twin C becomes thicker after the twinning intersection. In this area, there exist large numbers of dislocations. There is a strong strain field at the intersection site, as confirmed by the obvious contrast. The pre-existing dislocations around the twin A pile up and lead to the present contrast.	0
The twinning intersection in  is schematically illustrated in . The twin B can pass through the impeding twin A smoothly while the twin C can not pass, as shown in (a). With TMF cycling going on, more and more dislocations are introduced around the A/C intersection site, forming localized strain field. And new twinning dislocations emerge due to the higher stress concentration and propagate along {111} planes, thus the thickness of twin C can be larger (the red part as shown in (b)). The twin A still grows after interacting with twin B. However, the additional blue part of the twin A can pass through the twin B and is further stopped by the existing dislocations at the A/C intersection site.	0
 is a schematic illustration of interactions between a propagating twin and a pre-existing twin in the superalloy. If there are no or few dislocations around the pre-existing twin, the propagating twin (gray) can pass through it smoothly as shown in (a). In the early stage of the TMF cycling, there are few dislocations in the superalloy, so the twinning dislocations can move straight. If there are tangled dislocations around the pre-existing twin, some twinning dislocations will be hindered and part of the growing twin will cease its propagation ((b)). If there are large amounts of tangled dislocations, the growing twin (gray) will thoroughly terminate as shown in (c). During the period of tensile plastic deformation, a large number of dislocations are introduced, and therefore twinning dislocations can not pass through the tangled dislocations. In a word, the handicap for twin propagation increases significantly with the introduction of tangled dislocations.	0
The thermomechanical fatigue tests have been carried out in the nickel-base single crystal TMS-82 superalloy. The characteristics of twin-dislocation and twin–twin interactions have been investigated on the basis of TEM and SEM observations. Conclusions have been drawn as follows:	0
For a growing twin, the pre-existing dislocations have a distinctly effect on the movement of its twinning dislocations. When large amounts of dislocations are introduced, twinning dislocations can be hindered in varying degrees with forming a step on the twin boundary or even be forced to stop slipping. But at the primary stage of TMF cycling, twinning dislocations can move straight, producing a twin with constant width.	0
If tangled dislocations emerge after a deformation twin has formed, they will not affect the morphology of a pre-existing twin.	0
Twin–twin interactions are also related to the existence of dislocations. If there are no or few dislocations around the pre-existing twin, the growing twin can pass through it smoothly. If large numbers of dislocations are distributed around the pre-existing twin, the growing twin will be stopped at the intersection site.	0
