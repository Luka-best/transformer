       "   'text': [\"To answer this, we probably need to look at why we use AC in buildings in the first place. When you transmit electricity from the power station to the consumers, you can choose to do it with a high current/low voltage, or low current/high voltage. We choose to do as much of the transmission as possible using the low current/high voltage as, because high currents have a nasty habit of heating the cables up excessively. At home, though, we use a low(ish) voltage, and so we need to be able to convert between the high transmission voltage and low domestic voltage - to do this, we use devices called transformers, and transformers only work with AC. If we didn't use AC, we'd need large numbers of local power stations close to consumers. In a car, though, we have a different system - firstly, the distance thing isn't such an issue - you're generating your electricity locally, so we don't need to worry about sending it over miles and miles of cabling. Secondly, though, there's the fact that, at the heart of your car's electrical system is a battery - and batteries store and put out DC current, and so that's what's used. Sure, you can convert it to AC at an appropriate voltage to run small appliances from home, but the majority of things that people want to run in their cars these days run on DC anyway, so it's not really a concern.\",\n",
       "    \"Electrical devices *for the home* tend to run on AC because AC is a lot more efficient for long-distance distribution. Cars run on DC because it's more directly usable  &  that's what the alternator produces. The standard car plug was originally designed to just run a cigarette lighter. They only became widely used for accessories because everyone already had one for smoking - they weren't *designed* to be a ubiquitous, general-purpose power delivery outlet. Adding the electronics to convert car DC to a home AC outlet would be expensive and not widely used. How often do you need to use your blender or your alarm clock in the car?\",\n",
       "    \"It's cheaper, as the car already provides a DC output somewhere around 12v (frequently a bit over). Many consumer electronics that are commonly used in cars run off 5v DC and cheap adapters can be made to provide such an output. Providing an AC output would be an expensive feature few people use.\",\n",
       "    \"Cars run off the battery which is DC. So most electrical equipment in the cars are made to be compatible with the DC battery and so it only outputs in DC, like the cigarette lighter. To get AC from a car, you would need to separately purchase a DC to AC converter. Or if the car manufacturer wanted to throw one in, it would increase the price of the car. Thing about those converters is they can be unreliable plus they will seriously drain the battery and lower the performance of the car. That's why they don't have AC plugs normally. Except for RVs\",\n",
       "    'I’m assuming it’s because the electrics on a car only use the DC battery, and pretty much all electricity generated from the engine goes on to charge the battery. Some, if not most, electrical devices require DC, which becomes DC through a device called an Electrical Rectifier if the supply is AC.',\n",
       "    'the car batery puts out DC, power plants put out AC. We could have AC car plugs or DC electrical devices but more expensive to install in the car, and almost impossible for power plants to transport the power.'],\n",

       "  '<P> Auxiliary car power outlet\\n The auxiliary car power outlet (also known as \"car outlet\", \"automotive power socket\", \"automobile outlet\", \"vehicular outlet\", and similar; formerly known as \"cigarette lighter receptacle\", \"cigar lighter receptacle\" or \"cigar lighter socket\") in an automobile was initially designed to power an electrically heated cigarette lighter, but became a de facto standard DC connector to supply electrical power for portable accessories used in or near an automobile, directly from the vehicle\\'s electrical system\\n In most vehicles, at least one car outlet is present. Some vehicles, especially vans, tend to have more power outlets, usually one for the <P> therefore given to avoiding short circuits of the vehicle battery, rather than of the charger.\\n Car lighter sockets and plugs.\\n The car power outlet is also called a cigarette lighter receptacle, or cigar lighter receptacle, since it was originally designed as a lighter for cigars—hence its rather large size. Nowadays, it is used to power automotive accessories such as portable inverters, mobile phone chargers and portable fridges.\\n These sockets were not originally designed to provide DC power, and are not an ideal DC connector for several reasons, but still widely used for compatibility to existing accessories. Three sizes exist, one <P> can vibrate out of the socket under normal driving conditions, owing to poor retention. Also, there have been reports of melted plug tips due to poor contact and heat generation from ohmic resistance. Non-vehicular use in stationary settings may avoid vibration problems when used as an alternative to 120 volt AC outlets, but low-quality connectors may still develop high resistance or intermittent contact.\\n As a DC power connector, it has the disadvantages of bulkiness, relatively low current rating, and poor contact reliability. However, due to it\\'s large diameter, the connector and appliances can have a robust design against damage such <P> cord sets that insert into cigarette lighter receptacles. In Europe, 12 volt plugs and sockets are not specially regulated, and do not require approvals for the CE mark.\\n The male plug is sometimes used to feed power \"into\" a vehicle to recharge its battery, because it usually has no regulatory circuitry between the outlet and the car battery. For instance, portable solar battery maintainers generally connect to a vehicle\\'s battery in this manner. Trickle chargers also sometimes connect in this way, eliminating the need to leave a vehicle\\'s hood open, as well as eliminating the possibility of reversed polarity. Most <P> front passengers, one for the rear passengers and one for the luggage trunk.\\n The voltage of the power outlet is usually near 12 V DC, (14V to 15V while the running engine is turning the alternator, in order to charge the car battery while providing electrical power), because it is unregulatedly directly powered from the car\\'s electrical system.\\n Accessories.\\n Most accessories that can be plugged into the outlet are rated for input voltages of up to 24V, some are even rated for 30V or 32V, because larger vehicles such as lorry trucks and busses often have 24-volt electrical systems, with <P> cover without the lighter heating element. However, the socket has been repurposed and continues to be used to power consumer electronics in vehicles. Often, a vehicle may come with several outlets for convenience, some in the rear passenger area of the vehicle or even the cargo area, for powering portable devices. These outlets usually have a plastic cap tethered to them, and are usually labeled as being only for DC power, because they are not intended to withstand the heat produced by an electrical cigarette lighter.\\n The use of cigarette lighter receptacles to supply 12 volt DC power is an <P> the socket-outlet. Moulded plugs for unearthed, double-insulated appliances may instead have a non-conductive plastic pin (an Insulated Shutter Opening Device or ISOD) the same size and shape as an earth pin, to open the shutters. When looking at the plug pins with the earth uppermost the lower left pin is line, and the lower right is neutral.\\n UK Consumer Protection legislation requires that most domestic electrical goods sold must be provided with fitted plugs to BS\\xa01363-1. These are usually, but not necessarily, non-rewirable. Rewirable plugs for hand-wiring with a screwdriver are commonly available and must be provided with instructions.\\n BS <P> for a voltage as high as 15 without step down DC-to-DC converter.\\n Modern AC and USB EmPower Outlets.\\n EmPower is a 110 volt universal connector type found on many commercial airlines designed to provide power to travelers\\' electronic devices. The system is limited to 200VA. The EmPower universal AC Outlet Unit is compatible with plugs from over 170 countries and is designed such that 110VAC power is not present at the outlet until a suitable plug is fully inserted.\\n EmPower is a trademark registered initially by Primex Technologies (VA) and assigned to Astronics Advanced Electronic Systems, Inc in Kirkland, Washington, <P> two types and in order to standardize and remove a maintenance risk, in the early 1980s, three battery-powered units were constructed which mounted on a standard lamp bracket with no need to draw power from the train. This allowed the power and control circuitry for warning units to be removed during (and thus simplifying) overhaul. The old power sockets were gradually removed and plated-over but some remained until withdrawal of the stock. These new units also enabled other types of stock to use the tramway. They were smaller, had an on/off switch on the rear of the unit and no <P> the car. It is intended for use in the home or other domestic places. This has a local plug at one end and a Yazaki connector at the other. There is an in-line control box in the middle of this lead/cord that functions similarly to the fast charger but limits current to 10 Amps, enabling an eight-hour charge time (from complete depletion on 230 volts).\\n Specifications. Emergency power supply and V2G.\\n In the aftermath of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Mitsubishi introduced one year ahead of schedule a device called MiEV Power Box that enables the i-MiEV to supply power',\n",
