    "Imagine that you are taken with a sudden desire to understand **how the fruit of a tropical tree gets transformed into chocolate bars**, or want to understand **the role of fever in the human body's immune response**: how would you go about finding that information?\n",
    "\n",
    "If your specific question has already been asked and answered clearly and succintly on one of the many question answering platforms available on the Internet (such as [**Quora**](https://www.quora.com/How-is-chocolate-made), [**Reddit**](https://www.reddit.com/user/ex_5_libris/comments/9c8gb1/chocolate_how_chocolate_is_made/), or [**Yahoo Answers**](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070615082202AArsYN1)), you're in luck: modern search engines will probably take you to that pre-existing answer pretty reliably in a matter of a few clicks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, the process will be a little more involved. You will likely have to collect relevant information from a variety of sources, figure out how these pieces of knowledge fit together in relation to your query, and synthetize a narrative that answers your initial question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, wouldn't it be great if your computer could do all of that for you: **gather** the right sources, **synthetize** the information, and **write up** an easy-to-read summary of the relevant points? Such a system isn't quite available yet, at least not one that can provide *reliable* information in its summary. However, a number of recent advances in natural language understanding and generation have made working toward solving this problem much easier! These advances include progress in the pre-training (e.g. [BART](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461), [T5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683)) and evaluation (e.g. for [factuality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04228)) of sequence-to-sequence models for conditional text generation, new ways to use language understanding models to find information in Wikipedia (e.g. [REALM](https://kentonl.com/pub/gltpc.2020.pdf), [DPR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04906)), and new [training datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09190).\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this notebook,** we show how we can take advantage of some of these recent works to train a **long form question answering** system which takes in a question, fetches 10 relevant passages from a [Wikipedia snapshot](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.lrec-1.297/), and writes a multi-sentence answer based on the question and retrieved passages.

    "Let's recap: we are interested in the task of Long Form Question Answering. As in other Question Answering tasks, the model is presented with a question, and is required to generate a natural language answer. Whereas a majority of QA datasets contain mostly **factoid** questions, where the answer, such as a date or the name of a single entity, can be expressed in a few words or single sentence, Long Form QA focuses on questions which call for an **explanation** consisting of a few sentences or a few paragraphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to teach a model to answer such questions, we use questions and answers written by Reddit users. Note that the `nlp.load_dataset` command above actually downloaded questions and their associated answers from the [r/explainlikeimfive](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/), [r/askscience](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/), and [r/AskHistorians](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/) subreddits.

    "\n",
    "First, note that in this case **we have two answers** which broadly describe the same phenomenon: the first one is scored higher because it is more succint and to the point. This example already illustrates one important feature of the LFQA task: **there are usually several valid ways to answer a given question.** Of the 272K examples in the ELI5 training set, nearly two thirds (167K) have at least two answers. We'll need to keep this in mind when training and evaluation of the model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, we need to give our model access to the information that is expressed in both these answers. While recently released large models have been shown to hold a significant amount of information about the world in their parameters (see e.g. the [Closed-book QA performance of the T5 model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08910)), there are several advantages to giving the model explicit access to information in text form. First, a larger number of parameters in a model implies a larger computational cost. Secondly, getting information from a text database allows us to easily update the model's knowledge without having to re-train its parameters.\n",

    "Here, we choose to give the model access to Wikipedia text. We follow previous work in splitting Wikipedia articles into disjoint snippets of 100 words, and keep track of the title of the article and sections a snippet came from. Here's how you can get a pre-processed Wiki40b version split into 100-word passages with the `nlp` library, and an example snippet which has some of the information we're looking for (\"*little conduction would occur since air is a poor conductor of heat*\"):"
