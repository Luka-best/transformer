    "Imagine that you are taken with a sudden desire to understand **how the fruit of a tropical tree gets transformed into chocolate bars**, or want to understand **the role of fever in the human body's immune response**: how would you go about finding that information?\n",
    "\n",
    "If your specific question has already been asked and answered clearly and succintly on one of the many question answering platforms available on the Internet (such as [**Quora**](https://www.quora.com/How-is-chocolate-made), [**Reddit**](https://www.reddit.com/user/ex_5_libris/comments/9c8gb1/chocolate_how_chocolate_is_made/), or [**Yahoo Answers**](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070615082202AArsYN1)), you're in luck: modern search engines will probably take you to that pre-existing answer pretty reliably in a matter of a few clicks.  \n",

    "Otherwise, the process will be a little more involved. You will likely have to collect relevant information from a variety of sources, figure out how these pieces of knowledge fit together in relation to your query, and synthetize a narrative that answers your initial question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, wouldn't it be great if your computer could do all of that for you: **gather** the right sources, **synthetize** the information, and **write up** an easy-to-read summary of the relevant points? Such a system isn't quite available yet, at least not one that can provide *reliable* information in its summary. However, a number of recent advances in natural language understanding and generation have made working toward solving this problem much easier! These advances include progress in the pre-training (e.g. [BART](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461), [T5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683)) and evaluation (e.g. for [factuality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04228)) of sequence-to-sequence models for conditional text generation, new ways to use language understanding models to find information in Wikipedia (e.g. [REALM](https://kentonl.com/pub/gltpc.2020.pdf), [DPR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04906)), and new [training datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09190).\n",

In particular, training embedding-based retrieval models to gather supporting evidence for open-domain questions is relativelhy new research area: the last few months have seen some significant progressin cases where direct supervision is available, or with extensive task-specific pretraining. Here, we show how the ELI5 dataset allows us to **train a dense retrieval system without access to either**, making dense retrieval models more accessible.

While Reddit hosts a number of thriving communities with high quality discussions, it is also widely known to have corners where sexism, hate, and harassment are significant issues. See for example the [recent post from Reddit founder u/spez](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/) outlining some of the ways he thinks the website's historical policies have been responsible for this problem, [Adrienne Massanari's 2015 article on GamerGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283848479_Gamergate_and_The_Fappening_How_Reddit's_algorithm_governance_and_culture_support_toxic_technocultures) and follow-up works, or a [2019 Wired article on misogyny on Reddit](https://www.wired.com/story/misogyny-reddit-research/).\n",

There are some encouraging signs for all of these communities: [r/explainlikeimfive](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/) and [r/askscience](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/) have similar structures and purposes, and [r/askscience](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/) was found in 2015 to show medium supportiveness and very low toxicity when compared to other subreddits (see a [hackerfall post](https://hackerfall.com/story/study-and-interactive-visualization-of-toxicity-in), [thecut.com write-up](https://www.thecut.com/2015/03/interactive-chart-of-reddits-toxicity.html) and supporting [data](https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~bsbell21/210/toxicity-vs-supportiveness-by-subreddit/#data)).

    "\n",
    "Let's recap: we are interested in the task of Long Form Question Answering. As in other Question Answering tasks, the model is presented with a question, and is required to generate a natural language answer. Whereas a majority of QA datasets contain mostly **factoid** questions, where the answer, such as a date or the name of a single entity, can be expressed in a few words or single sentence, Long Form QA focuses on questions which call for an **explanation** consisting of a few sentences or a few paragraphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to teach a model to answer such questions, we use questions and answers written by Reddit users. Note that the `nlp.load_dataset` command above actually downloaded questions and their associated answers from the [r/explainlikeimfive](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/), [r/askscience](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/), and [r/AskHistorians](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/) subreddits.

    "So here we have the question:\n",
    "> Why does water heated to room temperature feel colder than the air around it?  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This definitely requires a multi-step explanation: no single phrase can sum up all of the information we are looking for. Here are the answers that were given on ELI5, and were given scores of +5 and +2 respectively by Reddit users:\n",
    "> 1. Water transfers heat more efficiently than air. When something feels cold it's because heat is being transferred from your skin to whatever you're touching. Since water absorbs the heat more readily than air, it feels colder.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> 2. Air isn't as good at transferring heat compared to something like water or steel (sit on a room temperature steel bench vs. a room temperature wooden bench, and the steel one will feel more cold). When you feel cold, what you're feeling is heat being transferred out of you. If there is no breeze, you feel a certain way.  If there's a breeze, you will get colder faster (because the moving air is pulling the heat away from you), and if you get into water, its quite good at pulling heat from you. Get out of the water and have a breeze blow on you while you're wet, all of the water starts evaporating, pulling even more heat from you.  \n",
    "\n",
    "First, note that in this case **we have two answers** which broadly describe the same phenomenon: the first one is scored higher because it is more succint and to the point. This example already illustrates one important feature of the LFQA task: **there are usually several valid ways to answer a given question.** Of the 272K examples in the ELI5 training set, nearly two thirds (167K) have at least two answers. We'll need to keep this in mind when training and evaluation of the model.  \n",

    "Secondly, we need to give our model access to the information that is expressed in both these answers. While recently released large models have been shown to hold a significant amount of information about the world in their parameters (see e.g. the [Closed-book QA performance of the T5 model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08910)), there are several advantages to giving the model explicit access to information in text form. First, a larger number of parameters in a model implies a larger computational cost. Secondly, getting information from a text database allows us to easily update the model's knowledge without having to re-train its parameters.\n",

In other words, given a query, the system can efficiently return a list of documents that have the most TF/IDF-weighted words in common with that query.

Unfortunately, we do not have such annotations for the ELI5 data.
