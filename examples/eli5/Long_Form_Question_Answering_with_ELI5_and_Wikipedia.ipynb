    "Imagine that you are taken with a sudden desire to understand **how the fruit of a tropical tree gets transformed into chocolate bars**, or want to understand **the role of fever in the human body's immune response**: how would you go about finding that information?\n",
    "\n",
    "If your specific question has already been asked and answered clearly and succintly on one of the many question answering platforms available on the Internet (such as [**Quora**](https://www.quora.com/How-is-chocolate-made), [**Reddit**](https://www.reddit.com/user/ex_5_libris/comments/9c8gb1/chocolate_how_chocolate_is_made/), or [**Yahoo Answers**](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070615082202AArsYN1)), you're in luck: modern search engines will probably take you to that pre-existing answer pretty reliably in a matter of a few clicks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, the process will be a little more involved. You will likely have to collect relevant information from a variety of sources, figure out how these pieces of knowledge fit together in relation to your query, and synthetize a narrative that answers your initial question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, wouldn't it be great if your computer could do all of that for you: **gather** the right sources, **synthetize** the information, and **write up** an easy-to-read summary of the relevant points? Such a system isn't quite available yet, at least not one that can provide *reliable* information in its summary. However, a number of recent advances in natural language understanding and generation have made working toward solving this problem much easier! These advances include progress in the pre-training (e.g. [BART](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461), [T5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683)) and evaluation (e.g. for [factuality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04228)) of sequence-to-sequence models for conditional text generation, new ways to use language understanding models to find information in Wikipedia (e.g. [REALM](https://kentonl.com/pub/gltpc.2020.pdf), [DPR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04906)), and new [training datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09190).\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this notebook,** we show how we can take advantage of some of these recent works to train a **long form question answering** system which takes in a question, fetches 10 relevant passages from a [Wikipedia snapshot](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.lrec-1.297/), and writes a multi-sentence answer based on the question and retrieved passages. In particular, training embedding-based retrieval models to gather supporting evidence for open-domain questions is relativelhy new research area: the last few months have seen some significant progressin cases where direct supervision is available, or with extensive task-specific pretraining. Here, we show how the ELI5 dataset allows us to **train a dense retrieval system without access to either**, making dense retrieval models more accessible.

    "Before we go any further, let us take a moment to talk about the provenance of our training data. While Reddit hosts a number of thriving communities with high quality discussions, it is also widely known to have corners where sexism, hate, and harassment are significant issues. See for example the [recent post from Reddit founder u/spez](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/) outlining some of the ways he thinks the website's historical policies have been responsible for this problem, [Adrienne Massanari's 2015 article on GamerGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283848479_Gamergate_and_The_Fappening_How_Reddit's_algorithm_governance_and_culture_support_toxic_technocultures) and follow-up works, or a [2019 Wired article on misogyny on Reddit](https://www.wired.com/story/misogyny-reddit-research/).\n",

    "Detecting and Removing Multiclass Bias in Word Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04047) for word embeddings trained specifically on Reddit data), this problem is far from solved, and the likelihood that a trained model might learn the biases present in the data remains a significant concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, the magnitude of the problem depends on the specific communities/subreddits. This work uses data from [r/explainlikeimfive](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/), [r/askscience](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/), and [r/AskHistorians](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/). There are some encouraging signs for all of these communities: [r/explainlikeimfive](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/) and [r/askscience](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/) have similar structures and purposes, and [r/askscience](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/) was found in 2015 to show medium supportiveness and very low toxicity when compared to other subreddits (see a [hackerfall post](https://hackerfall.com/story/study-and-interactive-visualization-of-toxicity-in), [thecut.com write-up](https://www.thecut.com/2015/03/interactive-chart-of-reddits-toxicity.html) and supporting [data](https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~bsbell21/210/toxicity-vs-supportiveness-by-subreddit/#data)).

    "Let's recap: we are interested in the task of Long Form Question Answering. As in other Question Answering tasks, the model is presented with a question, and is required to generate a natural language answer. Whereas a majority of QA datasets contain mostly **factoid** questions, where the answer, such as a date or the name of a single entity, can be expressed in a few words or single sentence, Long Form QA focuses on questions which call for an **explanation** consisting of a few sentences or a few paragraphs.\n",

This example already illustrates one important feature of the LFQA task: **there are usually several valid ways to answer a given question.** Of the 272K examples in the ELI5 training set, nearly two thirds (167K) have at least two answers. We'll need to keep this in mind when training and evaluation of the model.  \n",

While recently released large models have been shown to hold a significant amount of information about the world in their parameters (see e.g. the [Closed-book QA performance of the T5 model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08910)), there are several advantages to giving the model explicit access to information in text form.

During the summer the air flow is reversed, with warm air flowing into the top of the tunnel and being cooled as it flows back out over the water.

    "The sparse retriever works by finding passages which feature the words from the query. However, it has no way to know *a priori* which of these words are more important in context, and seems to struggle with understanding the central theme of the query (human-perceived temperature).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, some recent works have taken advantage of advances in pre-trained contextual word representations to solve this problem. Models such as [DPR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04906) or [REALM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08909) for example learn to compute a vector representation of the query, as well as vector representations of Wikipedia passages in such a way that the passages that best answers a question maximize the dot product between the two representations. Retrieval is then reduced to a Maximum Inner Product Search, which can be executed efficiently using systems like [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss).\n",
    "\n",
    "These successes are very encouraging for our Open-Domain Long Form QA application. However, our task and setup do not quite meet the requirements of either of either of these approaches. On the one hand, the [DPR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04906) system is trained using gold passage annotations: most major QA dataset tell the system which Wikipedia passage contains the answer. Unfortunately, we do not have such annotations for the ELI5 data. On the other hand, while [REALM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08909) is trained without passage supervision, it requires a pretty expensive pre-training step with an [Inverse Cloze Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00300) (100,000 steps with batch size 4096), and the ability to re-compute the embeddings of all Wikipedia passages regularly during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to train a similar dense retrieval system at reduced cost without having access to gold passage annotation, we will have to **take advantage of another unique feature of our dataset**; namely, the fact that the long form answers are quite similar in style to the Wikipeduia passages we want to index. Our hypothesis then is that if we train a system to embed the questions and answers in our dataset in a way that allows us to easily match questions to answers, then using the answer embedder on Wikipedia passages should allow us to similarly match questions to supporting evidence from Wikipedia.\n",

    "Unfortunately, actually comparing all questions to all answers before taking every single gradient step is computationally prohibitive: instead, we follow previous work in simply processing medium to large batches of question-answer pairs, and making sure that the dot product of a question with its answer is larger than with all other answers in the batch, and *vice versa*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We use a cross-entropy loss for the multinomial distribution over all of the answers (or questions) in a batch, and make use of [PyTorch gradient checkpointing](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/checkpoint.html) to be able to use large batches with limited GPU memory: you can find all implementation details in the `RetrievalQAEmbedder` class in `eli5_utils.py`.\n",
