      "---- A ---- Higher octane rated fuels have a higher resistance to predetonation ( aka knocking ) . High compression engines put a lot more heat and pressure into the fuel in the cylinders . If the fuel detonates before the spark fires , and before the piston is at top dead center , it causes a loss of power , loss of efficiency , rough running , and can damage the engine . Most modern cars that require high octane fuel can also detect knocki9ng and retard the timing to prevent engine damage . This still results in less power and worse fuel mileage though . Premium fuel in a car that does n't require it does nothing but waste money . \n",

Autoweek Explains octane grades Premium gas is n’t snake oil , but it might also be a waste of your money June 14 , 2018 Share Facebook Tweet Pinterest Email Some new cars claim to require premium fuel , others recommend it and most new vehicles on the road today are perfectly happy with regular fuel with nary a hiccup . Simultaneously , we 're bombarded by fuel brands advertising how only their particular premium fuel will keep your car from exploding thanks to magical additives and cleaner combustion and less wear and on and on . So what is the actual difference between premium and regular fuel ? And how do cars truly benefit from one or the other ? <P> The main difference between fuel grades is the octane number . Regular fuel has a lower octane number ( 87 is common ) , while premium generally nets a 91 octane rating or higher . Cowland explains octane this way : “ A higher octane fuel has higher resistance to knock and gives the engine designer the ability to improve efficiency by the use of higher compression ratios and improved spark timing . <P> That ’s good -- but only when an engine is designed to take advantage of high - octane fuel . That 's the kicker : If your car is designed with a compression ratio and spark timing meant for regular fuel , you ’ll likely get no benefit from running premium . In fact , premium can even cause trouble in a car not designed to take it . “ In some cases , cold start performance and drivability could be affected due to the lower volatility of the premium fuel . <P> ” The bottom line is this : In the vast majority of cases , if the car will run better on premium ( or requires it ) , the manufacturer will make it very clear . If regular fuel is specified and there 's no comment about premium fuel in the owner 's manual or on the fuel filler door , putting premium in your car is just a waste of money . Listen to the manufacturer , not the fuel maker , or as Cowland put it , “ It is always advisable to use fuel with the recommended octane rating . \n",

The crudes used by the refineries are more and more difficult to refine. This results in a Diesel fuel of lower ignition quality. The use of Cetane Improver additives constitutes both a cost-effective and convenient way to reduce emissions and improve engine performance. Refiners also use Cetane Improver additives in their Premium Diesel fuel for enhanced performances. While gasoline needs a spark to be ignited, Diesel fuel requires only the <P> their 100 octane fuel. Similarly IFS add 10% ethanol to their 91 octane fuel, label it premium fuel and sell it more cheaply than regular unleaded. This is converse to the general practice of adding ethanol to a lesser quality fuel to bring its octane rating up to 91. Some concern was raised over the use of ethanol blend fuels in petrol vehicles in 2003, yet manufacturers widely claimed that their vehicles were engined for such fuels. Since then there have been no reports of adverse effects to vehicles running on ethanol blended fuels. Colombia\\'s ethanol program began in 2002, <P> a Sinclair gas station, complete with a large green Brontosaurus on the roof, on White Street in Danbury, Connecticut. Sinclair continues to use the green dinosaur, affectionately called \"Dino\" and markets all its products under the logo. Sinclair patented the gasoline additive SG-2000. The high-octane fuel blend is called \"Dino Supreme\" and regular gas is \"Dino\", trade names used since 1961 when many oil companies still used trade names for their fuels instead of generic terms such as \"regular,\" \"premium,\" or \"unleaded\". Before that time, Sinclair\\'s trade names for its gasoline products included \"Power X\" for high-octane fuel and \"Sinclair <P> reach 100 km/h from a standing start in 60 seconds.

If the company buys a fuel call option and the price of fuel increases, the company will receive a return on the option that offsets their actual cost of fuel. If the company buys a fuel call option, which requires an upfront premium cost, much like insurance, and the price of fuel decreases, the company will not receive a return on the option but they will benefit from buying fuel at the then-lower cost.

Fuel additives for use in cars designed for leaded fuel are available at most filling stations.

The Queensland biobased diesel mandate requires 0.5% of all diesel fuel sold to be biodiesel. The New South Wales mandate stipulates that biodiesel be at least 2% of all diesel sold.

Download all of Tesla ’s inventions and go through the work of the man who electrified the world . Nikola Tesla is commonly said to be the man who ‘ electrified the world . <P> Tesla Coils : Unleash the Aether . Nikola Tesla 's most significant contribution was not AC power , radio , or the induction motor , but what we call the Tesla Coil - a tool which allows for the power of the aether to be unleashed and harnessed . Now being launched through an open source project . <P> But schemes for extracting power had never been adequately conceived . Since his childhood , Tesla himself had dreamed of harnessing the power of the great natural wonder . And in late 1893 , his dream became a reality , when Westinghouse was awarded the contract to create the powerhouse . <P> Inventions of Nikola Tesla This book is a readable compendium of patents , diagrams , photos and explanations of the many incredible inventions of the originator of the modern era of electrification . In Tesla 's own words , are such topics as wireless transmission of power , death rays , and radio - controlled airships . In addition rare material on German bases in Antarctica and South America , and a secret city built at a remote jungle site in South America by one of Tesla 's students , Guglielmo Marconi . <P> Tesla ’s father , Milutin Tesla , was a priest and a writer , and he wanted his son to join the priesthood . In 1884 , Tesla arrived in the United States penniless , only with a letter of introduction to Thomas Edison , whose electrical inventions were hot items at the time . Edison hired Tesla to make improvements to Edison ’s inventions . <P> Tesla ’s AC system caught the attention of George Westinghouse , who was seeking a solution to supplying the nation with long - distance power . Convinced that Tesla ’s inventions would help him achieve this , in 1888 he purchased his patents for $ 60,000 in cash and stock in the Westinghouse Corporation . Tesla and Westinghouse were in direct competition with Thomas Edison , who was intent on selling his direct - current ( DC ) system to the nation . <P> With this success , the AC system would quickly become the preeminent power system of the 20th century , and it has remained the worldwide standard ever since . Tesla ’s Inventions … In addition to his AC power system and coil , Tesla also discovered , designed and developed ideas for a number of other important inventions , including , dynamos ( electrical generators similar to batteries ) and the induction motor ( photo below ) , many of which were officially patented by other inventors . He was also a pioneer in the development of neon and fluorescent lights , radar , X - rays , radio and remote control by radio . <P> This makes it difficult to know if some of his outrageous claims , especially later in life , were real and based on something definitive in his mind or not . Surprisingly his inventions were not based on a deep and sophisticated understanding of modern physics . He did not believe in subatomic particles or even the electron as a carrier of charge but believed in the notion of an “ ether ” that transmitted electrical energy . <P> But he died having spent the better part of his last decade collecting a pension and feeding pigeons , unable to persuade new investors to fund his latest wild visions . He died believing he could invent a weapon to end all war , a way for power to travel wirelessly across the oceans , and plan for harnessing energy from space . He died alone and in debt . <P> It was Westinghouse who went on to create a power plant at Niagara Falls to supply alternating current to New York City using advice and information from Tesla . ( Harnessing power from the falls had been Tesla ’s dream from childhood ) . Years later , after trying his best to discredit both A.C. and Tesla personally , Edison would admit that Tesla ’s alternating current was more practical for large scale power , and he developed respect for Tesla . <P> Tesla responded by demonstrating that AC was perfectly safe by famously shooting current through his own body to produce light . This Edison - Tesla ( GE - Westinghouse ) feud in 1893 was the culmination of over a decade of shady business deals , stolen ideas , and patent suppression that Edison and his moneyed interests wielded over Tesla 's inventions . Yet , despite it all , it is Tesla 's system that provides power generation and distribution to North America in our modern era . <P> 9 and 10 . Wireless Communications and Limitless Free Energy -- These two are inextricably linked , as they were the last straw for the power elite -- what good is energy if it ca n't be metered and controlled ? Free ? <P> In this way many “ obvious ” patents might still be protected by an “ innovation warrant ” of shorter duration . Another idea is that patent holders be forced to license their patents under certain situations , especially for complex products ; for example , after a certain time period and/or if the patent is not being used by the patent holder or by compulsory arbitration . As a side note , the patentability of software seems to be a particular pain - point3,9 . <P> His reputation among both scientists and the public was now at its peak but he became increasingly more reclusive and eccentric . He continued to come up with new inventions , including one for wireless transmission of electricity and one for radio controlled craft ; he also anticipated pulsed radar , harnessing solar power , and radio communication with other planets , but his eccentricities prevented him from getting either a fair hearing or profits . Although he could well have used the money , in 1912 he refused the Nobel Prize in physics because he claimed that corecipient Thomas Edison was not a true scientist . \n",

Today, although small Tesla coils are used as leak detectors in scientific high vacuum systems and igniters in arc welders, their main use is entertainment and educational displays.

It is now understood that inductive and capacitive coupling are \"near-field\" effects, so they cannot be used for long-distance transmission. However, Tesla was obsessed with developing a long range wireless power transmission system which could transmit power from power plants directly into homes and factories without wires, described in a visionary June 1900 article in Century Magazine; \"The Problem of Increasing Human Energy\". He claimed to be able to transmit power on a worldwide scale, using <P> through the collectors and storage tank) and, in active systems, involve either directly heating the water that will be used or heating a non-freezing heat-transfer fluid that then heats the water that will be used. Passive systems are cheaper than active systems since they do not require a pumping system (instead, they take advantage of the natural movement of hot water rising above cold water to cycle the water being used through the collector and storage tank). Other methods of harnessing solar power are solar space heating (for heating internal building spaces), solar drying (for drying wood chips, fruits, grains, <P> amateur to make, Tesla coils are a popular student science fair project, and are homemade by a large worldwide community of hobbyists.

In late 1886, Tesla met Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles F. Peck. The two men were experienced in setting up companies and promoting inventions and patents for financial gain. Based on Tesla\\'s new ideas for electrical equipment, including a thermo-magnetic motor idea, they agreed to back the inventor financially and handle his patents.

       "('<P> Americans and Native Americans with this allele have a reduced risk of developing alcoholism. Native Americans, however, have a significantly higher rate of alcoholism than average; it is unclear why this is the case. Other risk factors such as cultural environmental effects e.g. trauma have been proposed to explain the higher rates of alcoholism among Native Americans compared to alcoholism levels in caucasians. A genome-wide association study of more than 100,000 human individuals identified variants of the gene KLB, which encodes the transmembrane protein β-Klotho, as highly associated with alcohol consumption. The protein β-Klotho is an essential element in cell <P> academic literature on the issue, there is a \"substantial genetic component in Native Americans\" and that \"most Native Americans lack protective variants seen in other populations.\" Many scientists have provided evidence of the genetic component of alcoholism by the biopsychosocial model of alcoholism, but the molecular genetics research currently has not found one specific gene that is responsible for the rates of alcoholism among Native Americans, implying the phenomenon may be due to an interplay of multiple genes and environmental factors. Research on alcoholism in family systems suggests that learned behavior augments genetic factors in increasing the probability that children <P> are dying of diabetes, alcoholism, tuberculosis, suicide, and other health conditions at shocking rates. Beyond disturbingly high mortality rates, Native Americans also suffer a significantly lower health status and disproportionate rates of disease compared with all other Americans. — U.S. Commission on Civil Rights (September 2004) Recent studies also point to rising rates of stroke, heart disease, and diabetes in the Native American population. In a study conducted in 2006–2007, non-Native Americans admitted they rarely encountered Native Americans in their daily lives. While sympathetic toward Native Americans and expressing regret over the past, most people had only a vague understanding <P> Contemporary Native American issues in the United States are issues arising in the late 20th century and early 21st century which affect Native Americans in the United States. Many issues stem from the subjugation of Native Americans in society, including societal discrimination, racism, cultural appropriation through sports mascots, and depictions in art. Native Americans have also been subject to substantial historical and intergenerational trauma that have resulted in significant public health issues like alcoholism and risk of suicide. A little over one third of the 2,786,652 Native Americans in the United States live in three states: California at 413,382, Arizona <P> of Honor is a not so subtle dig at the suffering Native Americans experienced at the hands of Euro-Americans during their western expansion. One of the most intriguing themes explored is that of the white justice for indigenous Americans. The policies of the American government towards indigenous peoples are explored via Rudy becoming a vigilante and pursuing his own idea of justice. The anger that Rudy feels towards businesses selling liquor when welfare checks are released, by taking advantage of the alcoholism present on the reservation leads him to burning down one of these businesses. Critical reception for the film <P> in hospitals near reservations. Another contributing factor is that Native people generally wait longer for organ transplants than white people. Diabetes is primary cause of end-stage renal disease, and dialysis treatments and kidney transplants remain the most effective methods of treatment Another significant concern in Native American health is alcoholism. Alcoholism in the modern day is approached as a disease, and has been strongly linked to genetics and social circumstances. The rate of death from alcoholism in Native Americans is about five times that of all races in the United States. However, due to the nature of alcoholism and the <P> Americans living on the Navajo Nation will be assessed. The use of drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes on reservations is higher on Native American reservations than the national averages. According to research on alcoholism in Native American populations, \"the problem of alcohol abuse is now defined as one that is both foreign to and destructive of the traditional culture\" Native American youth show higher rates of drinking and drug use than most other racial or ethnic groups and those that live on reservations are at the highest risk of developing alcohol related problems. According to Kunitz study on alcoholism in Native <P> new cancer cases is the highest for Native Americans compared to other ethnic groups. Women have been diagnosed with later-stage breast and cervical cancer. Native Indian and Alaska Native people are disproportionately prone to colon and lung cancer. In some communities, this is consistent with a high prevalence of risk factors such as smoking. One research about the Pacific Northwest Native Americans found that there were many misidentified rates of cancer between 1996-1997. This misclassification was due to a low Native American blood quantum, resulting in an over-reported amount of Native Americans diagnosed with cancer. Because the research took data <P> heart disease, as well an increasing influence on symptoms of heart disease. Cancer has a documented presence among Native Americans, and the rates of certain types of cancer exceed that of the general population of the United States. For instance, Native American males were twice as likely to have liver cancer than white males in 2001–05. Women are 2.4 times as likely to contract and die from liver cancer as their white counterparts. Rates of alcoholism of Native Americans are also greater than in the general population. Stomach cancer was also 1.8 times more common in Native American males than <P> by Native Americans. Stereotypes become discrimination when the assumptions of being more prone to violence and alcoholism limit job opportunities. This leads directly to Indians being viewed less stable economically, making it more difficult for those that have succeeded to fully enjoy the benefits in the same way that non-Indians do, such as obtaining credit. For those that maintain them, stereotypes prevent a more accurate view of Indians and the history of the United States. Research also demonstrates the harm done to society by stereotyping of any kind. Two studies examined the effect of exposure to an American Indian sports',\n",

I collected 87 articles published between 1985 and 1990 which included the key words , \" Patient Zero , \" \" Gaetan Dugas , \" \" Randy Shilts , \" or \" AIDS . \" The majority of these articles appeared in 1987 ( 37 ) and 1988 ( 23 ) , with all but one of the remaining articles published in 1989 or 1990 . <P> Later articles focus on film and television treatments of AIDS stories , including the movie adaptation of Shilts 's book . I adopted a critical rhetoric approach , gathering these fragments of discourse together in a way that provides an understanding of how terms such as \" Patient Zero \" circulated during this period and ways these texts operate to both create and reinforce power structures ( see McGee ; McKerrow ) . In using critical rhetoric as a methodological orientation , I move from a study of public address to a study of the \" discourse which addresses publics , \" taking on the role of an \" inventor \" who observes the social scene and analyzes communication fragments as \" mediated \" by popular culture and society ( McKerrow 101 ) . <P> Even as Shilts described in detail the failings of the government and scientific community , his treatment of Dugas played on the homophobia of the broader society and provided a single , tangible evil to blame for AIDS . Dugas is first referred to as \" Patient Zero \" on page 23 when Shilts wrote about Dugas 's \" unique role \" in the epidemic , one which included intentionally spreading AIDS ( 198 ) . In a reversal from his strategy of focusing on scene over agent , Shilts painted Dugas as an evil agent with the knowledge of what he was doing and the desire to spread suffering . Although Dugas 's story only takes up 46 pages of Shilts 's book , Patient Zero became the focus of media coverage , overshadowing Shilts 's careful resistance narrative . Newspaper headlines read \" Patient Zero : The airline steward who carried a disease and a grudge \" ( Shilts \" Patient Zero \" ) and numerous articles referred to Dugas as \" Patient Zero \" ( see Associated Press ; Carswell ; Dunlop ; Lehmann - Haupt ; \" MDs Doubt Claim , \" ; O'Neill ) . While a few articles described Shilts 's reporting of Dugas 's behavior accurately , most chose to focus on the idea conveyed by the term \" Patient Zero . \" Headlines in October 1987 read \" Canadian blamed for bringing AIDS to US \" ( Bremner ) , \" Book singles out steward as AIDS culprit \" ( \" Book \" ) , and \" Seductive steward blamed for spread of AIDS to US \" ( Hill ) . <P> Shilts discussed the attention given Patient Zero and the irony of media focused on the dramatic story rather than policy ( Engel ; Sipchen ) : \" Here I 've done 630 pages of serious AIDS policy reporting with the premise that this disaster was allowed to happen because the media only focus on the glitzy and sensational aspects of the epidemic . My book breaks , not because of the serious public policy stories , but because of the rather minor story of Patient Zero \" ( qtd . in Engel ) . <P> Instead , the narrative that resonated with the media — and presumably the broader public — was that of Shilts 's alternative scapegoat : Patient Zero . Dugas : The Scapegoat Rotten with Perfection The concept of identifying a \" patient zero \" was not original to AIDS . The goal of discerning a single person as the starting point of an epidemic can be seen in other cases , such as the treatment of \" Typhoid Mary \" Mallon , who was identified as a typhoid carrier and quarantined for nearly three decades ( Leavitt ) . <P> , could be held accountable for their actions in the AIDS epidemic , future generations would learn from their failures and work to address health crises in a timelier manner . When applied to the story of Patient Zero , however , Shilts 's stated motive falls short . Although Shilts admitted that whether or not Dugas actually brought AIDS to the United States \" remains a question of debate , \" he attributed the first AIDS cases in New York and Los Angeles to Dugas and referred to his ubiquitous travel as an airline steward , facts that \" give weight to that theory \" ( 439 ) . <P> Howard , Jacqueline . \" The Truth about ' Patient Zero ' and HIV 's Origins . \" CNN , 29 Oct. 2016 , URL_4 . <P> Shilts , Randy . \" Patient Zero : The Airline Steward Who Carried a Disease and a Grudge . \" The Toronto Star , 12 Dec. 1987 , p.

David Heymann, infectious-disease epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, has questioned the importance of finding patient zero and has said: \"Finding patient zero may be important in some instances, but only if they are still alive and spreading the disease.

Instead, patient-reported outcomes refers to reporting situations in which only the patient provides information related to a specific treatment or condition; this information may or may not be of concern to the patient. Further, PROs should not be confused with PREMs (patient reported experience measures), which focus more on a patient\\'s overall experience versus a focus on specific treatment outcomes. The term PROs is becoming increasingly synonymous with \"patient reported outcome measures\" (PROMs). PRO is an umbrella term that covers a whole range of potential measurements, but it specifically refers to \"self-reporting\" <P> 1974. In Randy Shilts\\' 1987 book And the Band Played On (and the 1993 movie based on it), Dugas is referred to as AIDS\\' Patient Zero instead of \"Patient O\", but neither the book nor the movie states that he had been the first to bring the virus to North America. He was incorrectly called \"Patient Zero\" because at least 40 of the 248 people known to be infected by HIV in 1983 had had sex with him, or with someone who had sexual intercourse with him.

During early CDC analysis of cases in California, patient 057 (Dugas) was nicknamed patient \"O\" for \"outside the area\", but this was interpreted by others as Patient Zero. Dugas was particularly helpful in tracing his network of partners, providing <P> pregnancy she is abducted by the Kingpin and taken hostage. Patient Zero sends the Punisher to rescue her, but he is captured and tortured for the location of Patient Zero. Mary Jane threatens to kill herself so that she will not reveal Patient Zero\\'s location, but the Kingpin calls her bluff. Eventually Deadpool creates a distraction that allows her to free Punisher, who annihilates all of the cannibals and kills Kingpin. Mary Jane is reunited with Patient Zero, but is left distraught when Punisher kills him. Grieving, she is sent away from Manhattan by Punisher.

In some cases, a known or suspected patient zero may be informally referred to as an index case for the purpose of a scientific study, such as <P> A pandemic has broken out across Earth, and most of humanity has been killed by a virus.
