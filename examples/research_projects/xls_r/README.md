# Speech recognition community week - version 2 ü§ó

Welcome to the 2nd version of the speech recognition community week! 
The goal of this week is to make **robust** speech recognition models in as many 
languages as possible.

Welcome to the 2nd version of the speech recognition community event üéôÔ∏è !
The goal of this event is to build **robust**, **real-world** speech recognition (ASR) models in as many languages as possible üåèüåçüåé.

If necessary and available, free access to a V100 32 GB GPU will kindly be provided by the [OVH team](https://us.ovhcloud.com/) üöÄ.

This document summarizas all the relevant information required for the speech 
community event üìã.

Don't forget to sign up [here](TODO: Create google from) ü§ó.

## Organization

Participants are encouraged to leverage pretrained speech recognition checkpoints,
preferably [facebook/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53)  , to train a speech recognition system in a langauge of their 
choice.

Participants can make use of whatever data they think is useful to build a 
**robust** speech recognition system for **real-world** audio data. We strongly 
recommend to make use of [Mozilla's diverse Common Voice dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mozilla-foundation/common_voice_7_0) when training the model.
We kindly ask you to make sure the dataset that you are using for training 
has the appropriate licensing - see [here](TODO: ) for more information.

During the event the fine-tuned models will regularly be tested on a **development 
dataset** provided by the Hugging Face team and at the end of the event all models 
will be tested on a hidden **test dataset**. For each language, 
the best performing model will receive a prize üèÜ - more information regarding 
the testing [here](TODO: ) and prizes [here](TODO: ). We believe that framing the 
event as a competition is more fun, but at the core we strongly encourage 
participants to work together by helping each other to solve bugs, share important findings, etc... ü§ó.

If possible it is encouraged to fine-tune the models on local GPU machines, but 
if those are not available, the OVH cloud team kindly provides a limited 
number of GPUs for the event. For more information on how to get access to the GPU - see [here](TODO: ).


**Please note**:
All important announcement will be made on discord. Please make sure that 
you've joined the following discord server: TODO: fill out.
Please make sure that you have been added to the [Speech Event Organization](https://huggingface.co/speech-recognition-community-v2). You should have received an 
invite by email. If you didn't receive an invite, please contact the organizers, *e.g.* Anton, Patrick, or Omar on discord.

## How to install relevant libraries

The following libraries are required to fine-tune a speech model with ü§ó Transformers and ü§ó Datasets in PyTorch.

- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
- [Datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets)

We recommend to install the above libraries in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). 
If you're unfamiliar with Python virtual environments, check out the [user guide](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/). Create a virtual environment with the version of Python you're going
to use and activate it.

You should be able to run the command:

```bash
python3 -m venv <your-venv-name>
```

You can activate your venv by running

```bash
source ~/<your-venv-name>/bin/activate
```

To begin with please make sure you have PyTorch and CUDA correctly installed. 
The following command should return ``True``:

```bash
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"
```

If the above command doesn't print ``True``, in a first step, please follow the
instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/) to install PyTorch with CUDA.

We strongly recommend to make use of the provided PyTorch examples scripts in [transformers/examples/pytorch/speech-recognition](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/pytorch/speech-recognition) to train your speech recognition
system.
In all likelihood, you will adapt one of the example scripts, so we recommend forking and cloning the ü§ó Transformers repository as follows. 

1. Fork the [repository](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) by
   clicking on the 'Fork' button on the repository's page. This creates a copy of the code
   under your GitHub user account.

2. Clone your fork to your local disk, and add the base repository as a remote:

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/<your Github handle>/transformers.git
   $ cd transformers
   $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git
   ```

3. Create a new branch to hold your development changes. This is especially useful to share code changes with your team:

   ```bash
   $ git checkout -b a-descriptive-name-for-my-project
   ```

4. Set up a PyTorch environment by running the following command your virtual environment:

   ```bash
   $ pip install -e ".[torch-speech]"
   ```

   (If transformers was already installed in the virtual environment, remove
   it with `pip uninstall transformers` before reinstalling it in editable
   mode with the `-e` flag.)

   If you have already cloned that repo, you might need to `git pull` to get the most recent changes in the `transformers`
   library.

   Running this command will automatically install `pytorch` and most relevant 
   libraries required for fine-tuning a speech recognition system.

Next, you should also install the ü§ó Datasets library. We strongly recommend installing the 
library from source to profit from the most current additions during the community week.

Simply run the following steps:

```
$ cd ~/
$ git clone https://github.com/huggingface/datasets.git
$ cd datasets
$ pip install -e ".[streaming]"
```

If you plan on contributing a specific dataset during 
the community week, please fork the datasets repository and follow the instructions 
[here](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-create-a-pull-request).

To verify that all libraries are correctly installed, you can run the following command in a Python shell.
It verifies that both `transformers` and `datasets` have been correcly installed.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCTC, AutoProcessor
from datasets import load_dataset

dummy_dataset = load_dataset("common_voice", "ab", split="test")

model = AutoModelForCTC.from_pretrained("hf-internal-testing/tiny-random-wav2vec2")
model.to("cuda")

processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("hf-internal-testing/tiny-random-wav2vec2")

input_values = processor(dummy_dataset[0]["audio"]["array"], return_tensors="pt", sampling_rate=16_000).input_values
input_values = input_values.to("cuda")

logits = model(input_values).logits

assert logits.shape[-1] == 32
```
