# Language model training examples

The following example showcases how to train a language model from scratch 
using the JAX/Flax backend.

JAX/Flax allows you to trace pure functions and compile them into efficient, fused accelerator code on both GPU and TPU.
Models written in JAX/Flax are **immutable** and updated in a purely functional
way which enables simple and efficient model parallelism.

## Masked language modeling in streaming mode

In the following, we demonstrate how to train a bi-directional transformer model 
using masked language modeling objective as introduced in [BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805).
More specifically, we demonstrate how JAX/Flax can be leveraged 
to pre-train [**`roberta-base`**](https://huggingface.co/roberta-base)
in Norwegian on a single TPUv3-8 pod.

The example script uses the ðŸ¤— Datasets library. You can easily customize them to your needs if you need extra processing on your datasets.

Let's start by creating a model repository to save the trained model and logs.
Here we call the model `"norwegian-roberta-base"`, but you can change the model name as you like.

You can do this either directly on [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/new) (assuming that
you are logged in) or via the command line:

```
huggingface-cli repo create norwegian-roberta-base
```

Next we clone the model repository to add the tokenizer and model files.

```
git clone https://huggingface.co/<your-username>/norwegian-roberta-base
```

To ensure that all tensorboard traces will be uploaded correctly, we need to 
track them. You can run the following command inside your model repo to do so.

```
cd norwegian-roberta-base
git lfs track "*tfevents*"
```

Great, we have set up our model repository. During training, we will automatically
push the training logs and model weights to the repo.

Next, let's add a symbolic link to the `run_mlm_flax.py`.

```bash
export MODEL_DIR="./norwegian-roberta-base"
ln -s ~/transformers/examples/flax/language-modeling/run_mlm_flax.py run_mlm_flax.py
```

### Train model

Next we can run the example script to pretrain the model:

```bash
./run_mlm_flax.py \
    --output_dir="${MODEL_DIR}" \
    --model_type="roberta" \
    --config_name="${MODEL_DIR}" \
    --tokenizer_name="${MODEL_DIR}" \
    --dataset_name="oscar" \
    --dataset_config_name="unshuffled_deduplicated_no" \
    --max_seq_length="128" \
    --weight_decay="0.01" \
    --per_device_train_batch_size="128" \
    --per_device_eval_batch_size="128" \
    --learning_rate="3e-4" \
    --warmup_steps="1000" \
    --overwrite_output_dir \
    --pad_to_max_length \
    --num_train_epochs="18" \
    --adam_beta1="0.9" \
    --adam_beta2="0.98" \
    --push_to_hub
```
