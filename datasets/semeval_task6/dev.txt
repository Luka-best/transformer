Like O
many O
of O
the O
modern O
bureaucratic O
reforms O
in O
the O
United O

, O
both O
emerged O
during O
a O
period O
of O
heightened O
skepticism O
about O
government O
activities O
. O

6951 O
. O

They O
turn O
instead O
to O
the O
vast O
government O
bureaucracy O
to O
provide O
policy O
guidance O
. O

For O
example O
, O
when O
Congress O
passed O
the B-Term
Clean I-Term
Water I-Term
Act I-Term
( I-Term
1972 I-Term
) I-Term
, O
it B-Definition
dictated I-Definition
that I-Definition
steps I-Definition
should I-Definition
be I-Definition
taken I-Definition
to I-Definition
improve I-Definition
water I-Definition
quality I-Definition
throughout I-Definition
the I-Definition
country I-Definition
. O

But O
it O
ultimately O
left O
it O
to O
the O
bureaucracy O
to O
figure O
out O
exactly O
how O
‘ O
clean’ O
water O
needed O
to O
be O
. O

6954 O
. O

For O
example O
, O
your O
home O
or O
apartment O
is O
a O
private O
good O
reserved O
for O
your O
own O
use O
because O
you O
pay O
rent O
or O
make O
mortgage O
payments O
for O
the O
privilege O
of O
living O
there O
. O

Further O
, O
private O
goods O
are O
finite O
and O
can O
run O
out O
if O
overused O
, O
even O
if O
only O
in O
the O
short O
term O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
private O
goods O
are O
excludable O
and O
finite O
makes O
them O
tradable O
. O

In O
societies O

, O
in O
contrast O
, O

tend O

Because O

A O

nature O
of O
its O

In O

when O

that O

The O

Informal O

continue O
the O
tradition O

The O

In O
1971 O
, O
the O
Supreme O

heard O

the O
U.S. O

to O
stop O
the O

The O
Supreme O
Court O
ruled O
that O

the O

can O
impose O
prior O
restraint O
on O
the O
media O
, O
meaning O
the O
government O
can O
prevent O

journalists O
expected O

But O
William O

, O
a O
Union O
general O
, O
maintained O
distance O
between O
the O

his O
military O
. O

Following O
the O
publication O
of O
material O
Sherman O
believed O
to O
be O
protected O
by O

censorship O
, O
a O
journalist O
was O
arrested O

nearly O
put O

death O

Because O
White O

Section O

of O

Article B-Term

central O
( O

the O

is O
typically O
resolved O

of O
the O
central O

Although O
the O
U.S. O

clearly O
allocated O

Theorists O
have O
long O
proposed O
that O

a O

In O
the O

: O
A O

from O

, O
Daniel O
Elazar O
first O
theorized O
in O
1966 O
that O
the O
United O
States O
could O
be O
divided O
into O
three O
distinct O
political O
cultures O
: O
moralistic O
, O
individualistic O

traditionalistic O
( O

The O
diffusion O
of O
these O
cultures O
throughout O
the O
United O
States O
is O
attributed O
to O
the O
migratory O
patterns O
of O
immigrants O
who O
settled O
in O

spread O
out O
across O
the O
