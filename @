# Fine-Tuning week of XLSR-Wav2Vec2 on 60 languages 🌍

Welcome to the fine-tuning week! The goal of this week is to have state-of-the-art Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models on as many languages as possible. The fine-tuning week ends on Friday, the 26th March at 12am PST time.

Participants are encouraged to fine-tune the pretrained [facebook/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53) checkpoint on one or more of the 60 languages of [Common Voice dataset](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets). 
Furthermore, it is very much appreciated if participants fine-tune XLSR-Wav2Vec2 on a language that does not occur on Common Voice.

All fine-tuned models uploaded until Friday, the 26th March 12am PST, will be taken into account for a competition and the best model per language will be awarded a prize if the best model performs reasonbly well.
The testing data to evaluate the models will be the official Common Voice *`test`* data of version 6.1. 
Again, participants are very much encouraged to fine-tune XLSR-Wav2Vec2 on languages that are not found in the [Common Voice dataset](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets) since those languages are even more likely to be underrepresented in the speech community. 
Each model fine-tuned on a language not found in Common Voice, will be evaluated by the Hugging Face after Friday, the 26th March 12am PST, and if the model performs reasonably well, the model 
receives a prize as well. For more information on which data can be used for training, how 
the models are evaluated exactly, and what type of data preprocessing can be used, please see ["Training and Evaluation Rules"](#training-and-evaluation-rules).

**Please keep in mind:**
The spirit of the fine-tuning week is to provide 
the community state-of-the-art speech recognition in as many languages as possible! So while 
we encourage a healthy competition between people/groups of the same language so that better 
results are obtained, it is **extremely important** that we help each other and share our
insights with the whole team/community. What matters in the end is what has been achieved by 
the team as a whole during the fine-tuning week. That being said, we strongly encourage people 
to share tips & tricks on the forum or on Slack, help each other when team members encounter 
bugs and to work in groups. To make it easier to share and help, forum threads have been created under the name {language} ASR: Fine-Tuning Wav2Vec2, *e.g.* [here](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/arabic-asr-fine-tuning-wav2vec2/4608). It is very much possible that prizes will be given to groups of 
people instead of individuals. Also don't hesitate to ask questions, propose improvements 
to the organization, to the material given to participants, etc...🤗

## How to fine tune XLSR Wav2Vec2

This chapter gives an in-detail explanation on how to fine-tune [Facebook's multi-lingual Wav2vec2](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53) on any language of the [Common Voice dataset](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets).

There are two possible setups which can be used to fine-tune Wav2Vec2. The easiest setup is to simply use [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). It is possible to train the full model in a *free* google colab, but it is recommended to use google colab pro since it has been shown to be more stable.

The other option is to run a script locally. While this can be more difficult to setup in also means that you have more control over the training run and probably access to better GPUs than you would have in a google colab. 
For small datasets, it is usually totally sufficient to train your model
in a google colab. For larger and thus more memory intensive datasets, it is probably
better to fine tune the model locally.

For each option, we explain in-detail how to fine-tune XLSR-Wav2Vec2 in the following.

### Google colab setup

**Note**: Instead of reading the following section, you can simply watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UynYn2C3tI0&ab_channel=PatrickvonPlaten) video, where Patrick explains how to adapt the google colab for your specific language.

**1.**: If you plan on training XLSR-Wav2Vec2 in a google colab, you should first make sure to have a valid gmail account. You can sign up for a gmail account [here](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?hl=en&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp). 
Having succesfully signed up for gmail, you can now sign into your account to make sure you are logged in when opening new tabs in your browser.

**2.**: Next, head over to the official [Fine-Tune XLSR-Wav2Vec2 with 🤗 Transformes](https://colab.research.google.com/github/patrickvonplaten/notebooks/blob/master/Fine_Tune_XLSR_Wav2Vec2_on_Turkish_ASR_with_%F0%9F%A4%97_Transformers.ipynb) google colab. The first thing you should do is to make a copy of it - click `->File->Save a copy in Drive`. This should save a copy of the google colab in your google drive. 

**3.**: Now it is highly recommended to carefully read the google colab without running the cells yet. 
You should get an understanding of the model is trained and what you will have to change when training the model in a different language. 
Having done so, you can again head over to [Common Voice](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets) and pick your a language you want to fine-tune [facebook/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53) on. Make sure you remember the language code (For each language, you can find it under the field "*Version*". It corresponds to **all characters before the first underscore**. *E.g.* for Greek it is *el*, while for Irish it is *ga-IE*.

**4.**: Now you should replace the language code used for the demo of this colab, being *tr* for Turkish with the language code corresponding to the language you just chose in the **second** cell of the google colab. This will load the correct data for your language.

**5.**: It is time start running the google colab! Make sure that you have selected "GPU" as your runtime environment and you can start running the cells one-by-one. Make sure you attentively read the text between the cells to understand what is happening and to eventually correct the cells to improve the fine-tuning script for your language. Things you might want to improve / change:
 
 - Data loading. It is very much recommended to use more than just the official training data of the Common Voice dataset. If you find more data on the internet, feel free to use it! Check out the section ["How to combined multiple datasets into one"](#how-to-combine-multiple-datasets-into-one)

- Data Processing. You should adapt the data processing to your specific language. In data processing, you should make the data more uniform so that it will be easier for the model to learn how to classify speech in your data. Here it can be really helpful to be proficient in the language to know what can be done to simplify the language withouth changing the meanning. 
Data processing methods include, but are not limited to:
	- Normalizing your data. Make sure all characters are lower-cased.
	- Remove typographical symbols and punctuation marks. See a list [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_typographical_symbols_and_punctuation_marks). Be careful to not remove punctation marks that can change the meaning of the sentence. *E.g.* you should not remove the single quatation mark `'` in English, as it would change the words `"it's"` to `"its"` which is a different word and has thus a different meaning. For more tips on data processing see ["How to effectively preprocess the data"](#how-to-effectively-preprocess-the-data")

- Hyperparameter Tuning. Depending on the size of the data you should probably change the hyperparameters of the google colab. You can change any parameter you like. For more tips and tricks see ["How to do hyperparameter tuning for my language"](#how-to-do-hyperparameter-tuning-for-my-language)

When running the google colab make sure that you uncomment the cell corresponding to mounting your gogle drive to the colab. This cells look as follows:

```python
# from google.colab import drive
# drive.mount('/content/gdrive/')
``` 

Uncomment it, run it, and follow the instructions to mount your google drive. This way you can be sure that the model parameters and created tokenizer & feature extractor files are saved in **your** google drive.

Also make sure that you uncomment the cells corresponding to save the preprocessing files and trained model weights to your drive. Otherwise you might loose a trained model if you google crashes. You should change the name of your model from `wav2vec2-large-xlsr-turkish-demo` to `wav2vec2-large-xlsr-{your_favorite_name}`.

Those cells correspond to:

```python
# processor.save_pretrained("/content/gdrive/MyDrive/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-turkish-demo")
```

and the line:

```python
  output_dir="/content/gdrive/MyDrive/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-turkish-demo",
```

further below (which should already be uncommented).

Having finished the training you should find the following files/folders under the folder `wav2vec2-large-xlsr-{your_favorite_name}` in your google drive:

- `preprocessor_config.json` - the parameters of the feature extractor
- `special_tokens_map.json` - the special token map of the tokenizer
- `tokenizer_config.json` - the parameters of the tokenizer
- `vocab.json` - the vocabulary of the tokenizer
- `checkpoint-{...}/` - the saved checkpoints saved during training. Each checkpoint should contain the files: `config.json`, `optimizer.pt`, `pytorch_model.bin`, `scheduler.pt`, `training_args.bin`. The files `config.json` and `pytorch_model.bin` define your model.

If you are happy with your training results it is time to upload your model! 
Download the following files to your local computer: **`preprocessor_config.json`, `special_tokens_map.json`, `tokenizer_config.json`, `vocab.json`, `config.json`, `pytorch_model.bin`**. Those files fully define a XLSR-Wav2Vec2 model checkpoint.

Awesome you have succesfully trained a XLSR-Wav2Vec2 model 😎. Now you can jump to the secttion ["How to upload my trained checkpoint"](#how-to-upload-my-trained-checkpoint)

### Local machine


## How to upload my trained checkpoint

To upload your trained checkpoint, make sure to follow the instructions [here](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_sharing.html) on how create a model repository on the 🤗 model hub .

Having created your model repository on the hub, you should clone it locally.

Then and add the following files that fully define a XLSR-Wav2Vec2 checkpoint into the repository. You should have added the following files.

- `preprocessor_config.json`
- `special_tokens_map.json`
- `tokenizer_config.json`
- `vocab.json`
- `config.json`
- `pytorch_model.bin`

Having added the above files, you should run the follwing to push files to your model repository.  
```
git add . && git commit -m "Add model files" && git push
```

The next **very important** step is to create the model card. For people to use your fine-tuned 
model it is important to understand: 
- What kind of model is it?
- What is your model useful for?
- What data was your model trained on?
- How well does your model perform?

Your model in then available under *huggingface.co/{your_username}/{your_chosen_xlsr-large_model_name}* for everybody to use 🎉.

## Further reading material

It is recommended that take some time to you read up on how Wav2vec2 works in theory. 
Getting a better understanding of the theory and the inner mechanisms of the model often helps when fine-tuning the model. 

**However**, if you don't like reading blog posts / papers, don't worry - it is by no means necessary to go through the theory in order to fine-tune Wav2Vec2 on your language of choice.

If you are interested in learning more about the model though, here are a couple of resources that are important to better understand Wav2Vec2:

- [Facebook's Wav2Vec2 blog post](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/wav2vec-state-of-the-art-speech-recognition-through-self-supervision/)
- [Official Wav2Vec2 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11477)
- [Official XLSR Wav2vec2 paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.13979.pdf)
- [Hugging Face Blog](https://huggingface.co/blog/fine-tune-xlsr-wav2vec2)
- [How does CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification) work](https://distill.pub/2017/ctc/)

It helps to have a good understanding on the following points:

- How was XLSR-Wav2Vec2 pretrained? -> Feature vectors were masked and had to be predicted by the model; very similar in spirit to masked language model of BERT.

- What parts of XLSR-Wav2Vec2 are responsible for what? What is the feature extractor part used for? -> extract feature vectors from the 1D raw audio waveform; What is the transformer part doing? -> mapping feature vectors to contextualized feature vectors; ...

- What part of the model needs to be fine-tuned? -> The pretrained model **does not** include a language head to classify the contextualized features to letters. This is randomely initialized when loading the pretrained checkpoint and has to be fine-tuned. Also, note that the authors recommend to **not** further fine-tune the feature extractor.

- What data was used to XLSR-Wav2Vec2? The checkpoint we will use for further fine-tuning was pretrained on **53** languages. 

- What languages are considered to be similar by XLSR-Wav2Vec2? In the official [XLSR Wav2Vec2 paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.13979.pdf), the authors show nicely which languages share a common contextualized latent space. It might be useful for you to extend your training data with data of other languages that are considered to be very similar by the model (or you).


## FAQ

- Can a participant fine-tune models for more than one languages? 
Yes! A participant can fine-tune models in as many languages she/he likes
- Can a participant use extra data (apart from the common voice data)?
Yes! All data except the official common voice `test data` can be used for training.
If a participant wants to train a model on a language that is not part of Common Voice (which 
is very much encouraged!), the participant should make sure that some test data is held out to 
make sure the model is not overfitting.
- Can we fine-tune for high-resource languages? 
Yes! While we do not really recommend people to fine-tune models in English since there are
already so many fine-tuned speech recognition models in English. However, it is very much 
appreciated if participants want to fine-tune models in other "high-resource" languages, such 
as French, Spanish, or German. For such cases, one probably needs to train locally and apply 
might have to apply tricks such as lazy data loading (check the ["Lazy data loading"](#how-to-do-lazy-data-loading) section for more details).
