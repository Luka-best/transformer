# Distributed training with ðŸ¤— Accelerate

As models get larger, parallelism has emerged as a strategy for training larger models on limited hardware and accelerating training speed by several orders of magnitude. At ðŸ¤— Hugging Face, we created the ðŸ¤— [Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/index.html) library to help users easily train a ðŸ¤— Transformers model on any type of distributed setup. In this tutorial, learn how to tweak your native PyTorch training loop to enable training in a distributed environment.

## Setup

Get started by installing ðŸ¤— Accelerate:

```bash
pip install accelerate
```

Then you can import and create an [`Accelerator`](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/accelerator.html#accelerate.Accelerator) object. [`Accelerator`] will automatically detect the type of distributed setup you are running, and initialize all the necessary components for distributed training. You don't need to explicitly place your model on a device.

```py
>>> from accelerate import Accelerator

>>> accelerator = Accelerator()
```

## Prepare to accelerate

The next step is to pass all the relevant training objects to the [`prepare`](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/accelerator.html#accelerate.Accelerator.prepare) method. This includes your training and evaluation DataLoaders, a model and an optimizer:

```py
>>> train_dataloader, eval_dataloader, model, optimizer = accelerator.prepare(
...     train_dataloader, eval_dataloader, model, optimizer
... )
```

## Backward

The last addition is to replace the typical `loss.backward()` in your training loop with the ðŸ¤— Accelerate [`backward`](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/accelerator.html#accelerate.Accelerator.backward) method:

```py
>>> for epoch in range(num_epochs):
...     for batch in train_dataloader:
...         outputs = model(**batch)
...         loss = outputs.loss
...         accelerator.backward(loss)

...         optimizer.step()
...         lr_scheduler.step()
...         optimizer.zero_grad()
...         progress_bar.update(1)
```

As you can see in the following image, you only need to add four additional lines of code to your training loop to enable distributed training!

## Train

Once you've added the relevant lines of code, you can launch your distributed training in a script or a notebook like Colaboratory.

### Train with a script

If you are running your training from a script, run the following command to create and save a configuration file:

```bash
accelerate config
```

Then you can launch your training with:

```bash
accelerate launch train.py
```

### Train with a notebook

ðŸ¤— Accelerate is also able to run in a notebook if you're planning on using Colaboratory's TPUs. Wrap all the code responsible for training in a function, and pass it to the `notebook_launcher` function:

```py
>>> from accelerate import notebook_launcher

>>> notebook_launcher(training_function)
```
