# Summarization

<Youtube id="yHnr5Dk2zCI"/>

Summarization creates a shorter version of a document or an article that captures all the important information. Along with translation, it is another example of a task that can be formulated as a sequence-to-sequence task. Summarization can be:

- Extractive: extract the most relevant information from a document.
- Abstractive: generate new text that captures the most relevant information. 

This guide will show you how to fine-tune [T5](https://huggingface.co/t5-small) on the California state bill subset of the [BillSum](https://huggingface.co/datasets/billsum) dataset for abstractive summarization.

<Tip>

See the summarization [task page](https://huggingface.co/tasks/summarization) for more information about its associated models, datasets, and metrics.

</Tip>

## Load BillSum dataset

Load the BillSum dataset from the ðŸ¤— Datasets library:

``````

Split this dataset into a train and test set:

``````

Then take a look at an example:

```py
```

The `text` field is the input and the `summary` field is the target.

## Preprocess

Load the T5 tokenizer to process `text` and `summary`:

``````

The preprocessing function needs to:

1. Prefix the input with a prompt so T5 knows this is a summarization task. Some models capable of multiple NLP tasks require prompting for specific tasks.
2. Use the keyword `text_target` argument when tokenizing labels.
3. Truncate sequences to be no longer than the maximum length set by the `max_length` parameter.

```py
>>> prefix = "summarize: "


>>> def preprocess_function(examples):
...     inputs = [prefix + doc for doc in examples["text"]]
...     model_inputs = tokenizer(inputs, max_length=1024, truncation=True)

```

Use ðŸ¤— Datasets [`~datasets.Dataset.map`] function to apply the preprocessing function over the entire dataset. You can speed up the `map` function by setting `batched=True` to process multiple elements of the dataset at once:

``````

Use [`DataCollatorForSeq2Seq`] to create a batch of examples. It will also *dynamically pad* your text and labels to the length of the longest element in its batch, so they are a uniform length. While it is possible to pad your text in the `tokenizer` function by setting `padding=True`, dynamic padding is more efficient.

## Train

<frameworkcontent>
<pt>
Load T5 with [`AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM`]:

<Tip>

If you aren't familiar with fine-tuning a model with the [`Trainer`], take a look at the basic tutorial [here](../training#finetune-with-trainer)!

</Tip>

At this point, only three steps remain:

1. Define your training hyperparameters in [`Seq2SeqTrainingArguments`].
2. Pass the training arguments to [`Seq2SeqTrainer`] along with the model, dataset, tokenizer, and data collator.
3. Call [`~Trainer.train`] to fine-tune your model.

```py
>>> training_args = Seq2SeqTrainingArguments(
...     output_dir="./results",
...     evaluation_strategy="epoch",
...     learning_rate=2e-5,
...     per_device_train_batch_size=16,
...     per_device_eval_batch_size=16,
...     weight_decay=0.01,
...     save_total_limit=3,
...     num_train_epochs=1,
...     fp16=True,
... )

>>> trainer = Seq2SeqTrainer(
...     model=model,
...     args=training_args,
...     train_dataset=tokenized_billsum["train"],
...     eval_dataset=tokenized_billsum["test"],
...     tokenizer=tokenizer,
```
</pt>
<tf>
To fine-tune a model in TensorFlow, start by converting your datasets to the `tf.data.Dataset` format with [`~datasets.Dataset.to_tf_dataset`]. Specify inputs and labels in `columns`, whether to shuffle the dataset order, batch size, and the data collator:

```py
>>> tf_train_set = tokenized_billsum["train"].to_tf_dataset(
...     columns=["attention_mask", "input_ids", "labels"],
...     shuffle=True,
...     batch_size=16,
...     collate_fn=data_collator,
... )

>>> tf_test_set = tokenized_billsum["test"].to_tf_dataset(
...     columns=["attention_mask", "input_ids", "labels"],
```

If you aren't familiar with fine-tuning a model with Keras, take a look at the basic tutorial [here](training#finetune-with-keras)!

</Tip>

Set up an optimizer function, learning rate schedule, and some training hyperparameters:

``````

Load T5 with [`TFAutoModelForSeq2SeqLM`]:

``````

Configure the model for training with [`compile`](https://keras.io/api/models/model_training_apis/#compile-method):

``````

Call [`fit`](https://keras.io/api/models/model_training_apis/#fit-method) to fine-tune the model:

``````
