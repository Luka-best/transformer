# Audio classification

<Youtube id="KWwzcmG98Ds"/>

Audio classification assigns a label or class to audio data. It is similar to text classification, except an audio input is continuous and must be discretized, whereas text can be split into tokens. Some practical applications of audio classification include identifying intent, speakers, and even animal species by their sounds.

This guide will show you how to fine-tune [Wav2Vec2](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-base) on the [MInDS-14](https://huggingface.co/datasets/PolyAI/minds14) to classify intent.

<Tip>

See the audio classification [task page](https://huggingface.co/tasks/audio-classification) for more information about its associated models, datasets, and metrics.

</Tip>

## Load MInDS-14 dataset

Load the [MInDS-14](https://huggingface.co/datasets/PolyAI/minds14) from the ðŸ¤— Datasets library:

``````

Split this dataset into a train and test set:

``````

Then take a look at the dataset:

```py
>>> minds
DatasetDict({
    train: Dataset({
        features: ['path', 'audio', 'transcription', 'english_transcription', 'intent_class', 'lang_id'],
        num_rows: 450
    })
    test: Dataset({
```

While the dataset contains a lot of other useful information, like `lang_id` and `english_transcription`, you will focus on the `audio` and `intent_class` in this guide. Remove the other columns:

``````

Take a look at an example now:

```py
>>> minds["train"][0]
{'audio': {'array': array([ 0.        ,  0.        ,  0.        , ..., -0.00048828,
```

The `audio` column contains a 1-dimensional `array` of the speech signal that must be called to load and resample the audio file. The `intent_class` column is an integer that represents the class id of intent. Create a dictionary that maps a label name to an integer and vice versa. The mapping will help the model recover the label name from the label number:

```py
>>> labels = minds["train"].features["intent_class"].names
```

Now you can convert the label number to a label name for more information:

``````

Each keyword - or label - corresponds to a number; `2` indicates `app_error` in the example above.

## Preprocess

Load the Wav2Vec2 feature extractor to process the audio signal:

``````

The [MInDS-14](https://huggingface.co/datasets/PolyAI/minds14) dataset has a sampling rate of 8000khz. You will need to resample the dataset to use the pretrained Wav2Vec2 model:

```py
>>> minds = minds.cast_column("audio", Audio(sampling_rate=16_000))
>>> minds["train"][0]
{'audio': {'array': array([ 2.2098757e-05,  4.6582241e-05, -2.2803260e-05, ...,
```

The preprocessing function needs to:

1. Call the `audio` column to load and if necessary resample the audio file.
2. Check the sampling rate of the audio file matches the sampling rate of the audio data a model was pretrained with. You can find this information on the Wav2Vec2 [model card]((https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-base)).
3. Set a maximum input length so longer inputs are batched without being truncated.

```py
>>> def preprocess_function(examples):
...     audio_arrays = [x["array"] for x in examples["audio"]]
```

Use ðŸ¤— Datasets [`~datasets.Dataset.map`] function to apply the preprocessing function over the entire dataset. You can speed up the `map` function by setting `batched=True` to process multiple elements of the dataset at once. Remove the columns you don't need, and rename `intent_class` to `label` because that is what the model expects:

``````

## Train

<frameworkcontent>
<pt>
Load Wav2Vec2 with [`AutoModelForAudioClassification`]. Specify the number of labels, and pass the model the mapping between label number and label class:

```py
>>> from transformers import AutoModelForAudioClassification, TrainingArguments, Trainer

```

<Tip>

If you aren't familiar with fine-tuning a model with the [`Trainer`], take a look at the basic tutorial [here](../training#finetune-with-trainer)!

</Tip>

At this point, only three steps remain:

1. Define your training hyperparameters in [`TrainingArguments`].
2. Pass the training arguments to [`Trainer`] along with the model, datasets, and feature extractor.
3. Call [`~Trainer.train`] to fine-tune your model.

```py
>>> training_args = TrainingArguments(
...     output_dir="./results",
...     evaluation_strategy="epoch",
...     save_strategy="epoch",
...     learning_rate=3e-5,
...     num_train_epochs=5,
... )

>>> trainer = Trainer(
...     model=model,
...     args=training_args,
...     train_dataset=encoded_minds["train"],
...     eval_dataset=encoded_minds["test"],
```
</pt>
</frameworkcontent>
