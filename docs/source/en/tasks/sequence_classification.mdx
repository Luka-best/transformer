# Text classification

<Youtube id="leNG9fN9FQU"/>

Text classification is a common NLP task that assigns a label or class to text. There are many practical applications of text classification widely used in production by some of today's largest companies. One of the most popular forms of text classification is sentiment analysis, which assigns a label like positive, negative, or neutral to a sequence of text. 

This guide will show you how to fine-tune [DistilBERT](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased) on the [IMDb](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imdb) dataset to determine whether a movie review is positive or negative.

<Tip>

See the text classification [task page](https://huggingface.co/tasks/text-classification) for more information about other forms of text classification and their associated models, datasets, and metrics.

</Tip>

## Load IMDb dataset

Load the IMDb dataset from the ðŸ¤— Datasets library:

``````

Then take a look at an example:

```py
>>> imdb["test"][0]
```

There are two fields in this dataset: 

- `text`: a string containing the text of the movie review.
- `label`: a value that can either be `0` for a negative review or `1` for a positive review.

## Preprocess

Load the DistilBERT tokenizer to process the `text` field:

``````

Create a preprocessing function to tokenize `text` and truncate sequences to be no longer than DistilBERT's maximum input length:

``````

Use ðŸ¤— Datasets [`~datasets.Dataset.map`] function to apply the preprocessing function over the entire dataset. You can speed up the `map` function by setting `batched=True` to process multiple elements of the dataset at once:

``````

Use [`DataCollatorWithPadding`] to create a batch of examples. It will also *dynamically pad* your text to the length of the longest element in its batch, so they are a uniform length. While it is possible to pad your text in the `tokenizer` function by setting `padding=True`, dynamic padding is more efficient.

## Train

<frameworkcontent>
<pt>
Load DistilBERT with [`AutoModelForSequenceClassification`] along with the number of expected labels:

``````

<Tip>

If you aren't familiar with fine-tuning a model with the [`Trainer`], take a look at the basic tutorial [here](../training#finetune-with-trainer)!

</Tip>

At this point, only three steps remain:

1. Define your training hyperparameters in [`TrainingArguments`].
2. Pass the training arguments to [`Trainer`] along with the model, dataset, tokenizer, and data collator.
3. Call [`~Trainer.train`] to fine-tune your model.

```py
>>> training_args = TrainingArguments(
...     output_dir="./results",
...     learning_rate=2e-5,
...     per_device_train_batch_size=16,
...     per_device_eval_batch_size=16,
...     num_train_epochs=5,
...     weight_decay=0.01,
... )

>>> trainer = Trainer(
...     model=model,
...     args=training_args,
...     train_dataset=tokenized_imdb["train"],
...     eval_dataset=tokenized_imdb["test"],
...     tokenizer=tokenizer,
```

<Tip>

[`Trainer`] will apply dynamic padding by default when you pass `tokenizer` to it. In this case, you don't need to specify a data collator explicitly.

</Tip>
</pt>
<tf>
To fine-tune a model in TensorFlow, start by converting your datasets to the `tf.data.Dataset` format with [`~datasets.Dataset.to_tf_dataset`]. Specify inputs and labels in `columns`, whether to shuffle the dataset order, batch size, and the data collator:

```py
>>> tf_train_set = tokenized_imdb["train"].to_tf_dataset(
...     columns=["attention_mask", "input_ids", "label"],
...     shuffle=True,
...     batch_size=16,
...     collate_fn=data_collator,
... )

>>> tf_validation_set = tokenized_imdb["test"].to_tf_dataset(
...     columns=["attention_mask", "input_ids", "label"],
```

<Tip>

If you aren't familiar with fine-tuning a model with Keras, take a look at the basic tutorial [here](training#finetune-with-keras)!

</Tip>

Set up an optimizer function, learning rate schedule, and some training hyperparameters:

```py
>>> from transformers import create_optimizer
>>> import tensorflow as tf

>>> batch_size = 16
```

Load DistilBERT with [`TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification`] along with the number of expected labels:

``````

Configure the model for training with [`compile`](https://keras.io/api/models/model_training_apis/#compile-method):

``````

Call [`fit`](https://keras.io/api/models/model_training_apis/#fit-method) to fine-tune the model:

``````
