# Text to speech

[[open-in-colab]]

Text-to-speech (TTS) is the task of creating natural-sounding speech from text, where the speech can be generated in multiple 
languages and for multiple speakers. The only text-to-speech model currently available in 🤗 Transformers 
is [SpeechT5](model_doc/speecht5), though more will be added in the future. SpeechT5 is pre-trained on a combination of 
speech-to-text and text-to-speech data, allowing it to learn a unified space of hidden representations shared by both text 
and speech. This means that the same pre-trained model can be fine-tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, SpeechT5 
supports multiple speakers through x-vector speaker embeddings. 

This guide illustrates how to:

1. Fine-tune [SpeechT5](model_doc/speecht5) that was originally trained on English speech on the Dutch (`nl`) language subset of the [VoxPopuli](https://huggingface.co/datasets/facebook/voxpopuli) dataset.
2. Use your fine-tuned model for inference.

Before you begin, make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed:

```bash
pip install datasets soundfile speechbrain accelerate
```

Install 🤗Transformers from source as not all the SpeechT5 features have been merged into an official release yet:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git
```

<Tip>

To follow this guide you will need a GPU. If you're working in a notebook, run the following line to check if a GPU is available: 

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

## Load the dataset

[VoxPopuli](https://huggingface.co/datasets/facebook/voxpopuli) is a large-scale multilingual speech corpus consisting of 
data sourced from 2009-2020 European Parliament event recordings. It contains labelled audio-transcription data for 15 
European languages. In this guide, we are using the Dutch language subset, feel free to pick another subset. 

Note that VoxPopuli or any other automated speech recognition (ASR) dataset may not be the most suitable 
option for training TTS models. The features that make it beneficial for ASR, such as excessive background noise, are 
typically undesirable in TTS. However, finding top-quality, multilingual, and multi-speaker TTS datasets can be quite 
challenging.

Let's load the data:

```py
>>> from datasets import load_dataset, Audio

>>> dataset = load_dataset("facebook/voxpopuli", "nl", split="train")
>>> len(dataset)
20968
```

20968 examples should be sufficient for fine-tuning. SpeechT5 expects audio data to have a sampling rate of 16 kHz, so 
make sure the examples in the dataset meet this requirement:

```py
dataset = dataset.cast_column("audio", Audio(sampling_rate=16000))
```

## Preprocess the data

Let's begin by defining the model checkpoint to use and loading the appropriate processor: 

```py
>>> from transformers import SpeechT5Processor

>>> checkpoint = "microsoft/speecht5_tts"
>>> processor = SpeechT5Processor.from_pretrained("microsoft/speecht5_tts")
```

### Clean up the text 

Start by cleaning up the text data. You'll need the tokenizer part of the processor to process the text:

```py
>>> tokenizer = processor.tokenizer
```

The dataset examples have both `raw_text` and `normalized_text` features. The SpeechT5 tokenizer doesn't have any tokens 
for numbers, and in `normalized_text` the numbers are written out as text. For that reason, use `normalized_text` as 
input text.

Given that SpeechT5 was trained on English language, the Dutch dataset may contain characters that are not in the 
SpeechT5 tokenizer vocabulary. If left as is, those will be converted to `<unk>` tokens. 
However, in Dutch a character such as **à** is used to stress syllables, so we can simply replace it with a without changing 
its meaning. To identify unsupported tokens, extract all unique characters in the dataset using the `SpeechT5Tokenizer` which 
works with characters as tokens. To do this, write the `extract_all_chars` mapping function that concatenates 
the transcriptions from all examples into one string and converts it to a set of characters. 
Make sure to set `batched=True` and `batch_size=-1` in `dataset.map()` so that all transcriptions are available at once for 
the mapping function.

```py
>>> def extract_all_chars(batch):
...     all_text = " ".join(batch["normalized_text"])
...     vocab = list(set(all_text))
...     return {"vocab": [vocab], "all_text": [all_text]}

>>> vocabs = dataset.map(
...     extract_all_chars, 
...     batched=True, 
...     batch_size=-1, 
...     keep_in_memory=True, 
...     remove_columns=dataset.column_names,
... )

>>> dataset_vocab = set(vocabs["vocab"][0])
>>> tokenizer_vocab = {k for k,_ in tokenizer.get_vocab().items()}
```

Now you have two sets of characters, one with the vocabulary from the dataset and one with the vocabulary from the tokenizer. 
By taking the difference between these sets, you can find the characters that are in the dataset but not in the tokenizer.

```py
>>> dataset_vocab - tokenizer_vocab
{' ', 'à', 'ç', 'è', 'ë', 'í', 'ï', 'ö', 'ü'}
```

Next, you can define a function to map these characters to valid tokens and then run it on the dataset. You don't need to handle 
space, that's already replaced by `▁` in the tokenizer.

```py
>>> replacements = [
...     ('à', 'a'),
...     ('ç', 'c'),
...     ('è', 'e'),
...     ('ë', 'e'),
...     ('í', 'i'),
...     ('ï', 'i'),
...     ('ö', 'o'),
...     ('ü', 'u'),
... ]

>>> def cleanup_text(inputs):
...     for src, dst in replacements:
...         inputs["normalized_text"] = inputs["normalized_text"].replace(src, dst)
...     return inputs

>>> dataset = dataset.map(cleanup_text)
```

Now that you have dealt with special characters in the text, it's time to move on to the audio.

### Speakers

VoxPopuli is a multi-speaker dataset. There are 20968 examples in the dataset, but how many speakers are there? Let's 
count unique speakers and how many examples they represent.

```py
>>> from collections import defaultdict
>>> speaker_counts = defaultdict(int)

>>> for speaker_id in dataset["speaker_id"]:
...     speaker_counts[speaker_id] += 1
```

By plotting a histogram you can get a sense of how much data there is for each speaker.

```py
>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

>>> plt.figure()
>>> plt.hist(speaker_counts.values(), bins=20)
>>> plt.ylabel("Speakers")
>>> plt.xlabel("Examples")
>>> plt.show()
```

TODO: image

Around one-third of speakers has fewer than 100 examples. Approximately ten or so speakers have more than 500 examples. 
To speed up training, let's limit the data to speakers that have between 100 and 400 examples. This also makes the 
dataset more balanced.

```py
>>> def select_speaker(speaker_id):
...     return 100 <= speaker_counts[speaker_id] <= 400

>>> dataset = dataset.filter(select_speaker, input_columns=["speaker_id"])
```

Let's check how many speakers remain: 

```py
>>> len(set(dataset["speaker_id"]))
42
```

Let's see how many examples are left: 

```py
>>> len(dataset)
9973
```

Just under 10k examples and ~40 unique speakers, which should be plenty.

Note: The speakers with few examples may potentially have plenty of audio available if the examples are long. However, 
scanning through the entire dataset to obtain this information is time-consuming as it requires loading and decoding 
each audio file. Here we skip this step.

### Speaker embeddings

To allow the TTS model to distinguish between multiple speakers, you'll need to create a speaker embedding for each example. 
The speaker embedding is an additional input into the model that captures a particular speaker's voice characteristics.
To create the speaker embeddings, use the [spkrec-xvect-voxceleb](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain/spkrec-xvect-voxceleb) 
model from SpeechBrain. 
Create a function `create_speaker_embedding()` that takes an input audio waveform and outputs a 512-element vector 
containing the corresponding speaker embedding.

```py
>>> import os
>>> import torch
>>> from speechbrain.pretrained import EncoderClassifier

>>> spk_model_name = "speechbrain/spkrec-xvect-voxceleb"

>>> device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
>>> speaker_model = EncoderClassifier.from_hparams(
...     source=spk_model_name, 
...     run_opts={"device": device}, 
...     savedir=os.path.join("/tmp", spk_model_name),
... )

>>> def create_speaker_embedding(waveform):
...     with torch.no_grad():
...         speaker_embeddings = speaker_model.encode_batch(torch.tensor(waveform))
...         speaker_embeddings = torch.nn.functional.normalize(speaker_embeddings, dim=2)
...         speaker_embeddings = speaker_embeddings.squeeze().cpu().numpy()
...     return speaker_embeddings 
```

Note: the `speechbrain/spkrec-xvect-voxceleb` model was trained on English speech from the VoxCeleb dataset, while the
training examples in this guide are in Dutch. We're assuming here that this model will still make reasonable speaker embeddings, but 
this may not be true. For better results, you may want to train an X-vector model on the target speech first.

### Processing the dataset

Finally, let's process the data into the format the model expects. Create a `prepare_dataset` function that takes in a 
single example and uses the `SpeechT5Processor` object to tokenize the input text and load the target audio into a log-mel spectrogram. 
It should also add the speaker embeddings as an additional input.

```py
>>> def prepare_dataset(example):
...     audio = example["audio"]

...     example = processor(
...         text=example["normalized_text"],
...         audio_target=audio["array"], 
...         sampling_rate=audio["sampling_rate"],
...         return_attention_mask=False,
...     )

...     # strip off the batch dimension
...     example["labels"] = example["labels"][0]

...     # use SpeechBrain to obtain x-vector
...     example["speaker_embeddings"] = create_speaker_embedding(audio["array"])

...     return example
```

Verify the processing is correct by looking at a single example:

```py
>>> processed_example = prepare_dataset(dataset[0]) 
>>> list(processed_example.keys())
['input_ids', 'labels', 'stop_labels', 'speaker_embeddings']
```

Speaker embeddings should be a 512-element vector:

```py
>>> processed_example["speaker_embeddings"].shape
(512,)
```

The labels should be a log-mel spectrogram with 80 mel bins.

```py
>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
>>> plt.figure()
>>> plt.imshow(processed_example["labels"].T)
>>> plt.show() 
```

TODO: image

Now apply the processing function to the entire dataset. This will take between 5 and 10 minutes.

```py
>>> dataset = dataset.map(prepare_dataset, remove_columns=dataset.column_names)
```

You'll see a warning saying that some examples in the dataset are longer than the maximum input length the model can handle (600 tokens). 
Remove those examples from the dataset. Here we go even further and to allow for larger batch sizes we remove anything over 200 tokens.

```py
>>> def is_not_too_long(input_ids):
...     input_length = len(input_ids)
...     return input_length < 200

>>> dataset = dataset.filter(is_not_too_long, input_columns=["input_ids"])
>>> len(dataset)
8259
```

Next, create a basic train/test split: 

```py
>>> dataset = dataset.train_test_split(test_size=0.1) 
```

### Data collator

Define a custom collator to combine multiple examples into a batch. This will pad shorter sequences with padding 
tokens. For the spectrogram labels, the padded portions are replaced with the special value `-100`. This special value 
tells the model to ignore that part of the spectrogram when calculating the spectrogram loss.

```py
>>> from dataclasses import dataclass
>>> from typing import Any, Dict, List, Union

>>> @dataclass
>>> class TTSDataCollatorWithPadding:
...     processor: Any

...     def __call__(self, features: List[Dict[str, Union[List[int], torch.Tensor]]]) -> Dict[str, torch.Tensor]:

...         input_ids = [{"input_ids": feature["input_ids"]} for feature in features]
...         label_features = [{"input_values": feature["labels"]} for feature in features]
...         speaker_features = [feature["speaker_embeddings"] for feature in features]

...         # collate the inputs and targets into a batch
...         batch = processor.pad(input_ids=input_ids, labels=label_features, return_tensors="pt")        

...         # replace padding with -100 to ignore loss correctly
...         batch["labels"] = batch["labels"].masked_fill(
...             batch.decoder_attention_mask.unsqueeze(-1).ne(1), -100
...         )

...         # not used during fine-tuning
...         del batch["decoder_attention_mask"]

...         # round down target lengths to multiple of reduction factor
...         if model.config.reduction_factor > 1:
...             target_lengths = torch.tensor([
...                 len(feature["input_values"]) for feature in label_features
...             ])
...             target_lengths = target_lengths.new([
...                 length - length % model.config.reduction_factor for length in target_lengths
...             ])
...             max_length = max(target_lengths)
...             batch["labels"] = batch["labels"][:, :max_length]

...         # also add in the speaker embeddings
...         batch["speaker_embeddings"] = torch.tensor(speaker_features)

...         return batch 
```

In SpeechT5, the input to the decoder part of the model is reduced by a factor 2. In other words, it throws away every 
other timestep from the target sequence. The decoder then predicts a sequence that is twice as long. Since the original 
target sequence length may be odd, the data collator makes sure to round the maximum length of the batch down to be a 
multiple of 2.

```py 
>>> data_collator = TTSDataCollatorWithPadding(processor=processor)
```

## Train the model

Load the pre-trained model from the same checkpoint as you used for loading the processor: 

```py
>>> from transformers import SpeechT5ForTextToSpeech

>>> model = SpeechT5ForTextToSpeech.from_pretrained(checkpoint) 
```

The `use_cache=True` option is incompatible with gradient checkpointing. Disable it for training.

```py 
>>> model.config.use_cache = False
```

Define the training arguments. Here we are not computing any evaluation metrics during the training process. Instead, we'll 
only look at the loss:

```python
>>> from transformers import Seq2SeqTrainingArguments

>>> training_args = Seq2SeqTrainingArguments(
...     output_dir="MariaK/speecht5_finetuned_voxpopuli_nl",  # change to a repo name of your choice
...     per_device_train_batch_size=4,
...     gradient_accumulation_steps=8,
...     learning_rate=1e-5,
...     warmup_steps=500,
...     max_steps=4000,
...     gradient_checkpointing=True,
...     fp16=True,
...     evaluation_strategy="steps",
...     per_device_eval_batch_size=2,
...     save_steps=1000,
...     eval_steps=1000,
...     logging_steps=25,
...     report_to=["tensorboard"],
...     load_best_model_at_end=True,
...     greater_is_better=False,
...     label_names=["labels"],
...     push_to_hub=True,
... )
```

Instantiate the `Trainer` object  and pass the model, dataset, and data collator to it.

```py
>>> from transformers import Seq2SeqTrainer

>>> trainer = Seq2SeqTrainer(
...     args=training_args,
...     model=model,
...     train_dataset=dataset["train"],
...     eval_dataset=dataset["test"],
...     data_collator=data_collator,
...     tokenizer=processor.tokenizer,
... ) 
```

And with that, you're ready to start training! Training will take several hours. Depending on your GPU, 
it is possible that you will encounter a CUDA "out-of-memory" error when you start training. In this case, you can reduce 
the `per_device_train_batch_size` incrementally by factors of 2 and increase `gradient_accumulation_steps` by 2x to compensate.

```py
>>> trainer.train() 
```

Push the final model to the 🤗 Hub:

```py
>>> trainer.push_to_hub()
```

## Inference

Great, now that you've fine-tuned a model, you can use it for inference!
Load the model from the 🤗 Hub: 

```py
>>> model = SpeechT5ForTextToSpeech.from_pretrained("MariaK/speecht5_finetuned_voxpopuli_nl") 
```

Pick an example, here we'll take one from the test dataset. Obtain a speaker embedding. 

```py 
>>> example = dataset["test"][304]
>>> speaker_embeddings = torch.tensor(example["speaker_embeddings"]).unsqueeze(0)
```

Define some input text and tokenize it.

```py 
>>> text = "hallo allemaal, ik praat nederlands. groetjes aan iedereen!"
```

Preprocess the input text: 

```py
>>> inputs = processor(text=text, return_tensors="pt") 
```

Create a spectrogram with your model: 

```py
>>> spectrogram = model.generate_speech(inputs["input_ids"], speaker_embeddings) 
```

Visualize the spectrogram, if you'd like to: 

```py
>>> plt.figure()
>>> plt.imshow(spectrogram.T)
>>> plt.show() 
```

TODO: image

Finally, use the vocoder to turn the spectrogram into sound.

```py
>>> with torch.no_grad():
...     speech = vocoder(spectrogram)

>>> from IPython.display import Audio
>>> Audio(speech.numpy(), rate=16000)
```

In our experience, it can be difficult to get good results out of this model. The results can be rather noisy and 
sometimes what the model outputs doesn't even sound like speech. A lot of this appears to be related to the speaker 
embeddings. Since SpeechT5 was pre-trained with English x-vectors, it gives the best results using those English speaker 
embeddings. So if the generated speech sounds bad, try using a different speaker embedding.

Training for longer should also improve the results. Even so, the speech clearly is Dutch instead of English, and it does 
capture the voice characteristics of the speaker (compare to the original audio in the example).
Another thing to experiment with is the model's configuration. For example, try using `config.reduction_factor = 1` to 
see if this improves the results.

A final note on ethical concerns: while TTS technology has many beneficial uses, it can also be used for nefarious 
purposes such as imitating someone's voice without their permission. Please use TTS wisely and responsibly!
