# Generation

Each framework has a generate method for auto-regressive text generation implemented in their respective `GenerationMixin` class:

- PyTorch [`~generation.GenerationMixin.generate`] is implemented in [`~generation.GenerationMixin`].
- TensorFlow [`~generation.TFGenerationMixin.generate`] is implemented in [`~generation.TFGenerationMixin`].
- Flax/JAX [`~generation.FlaxGenerationMixin.generate`] is implemented in [`~generation.FlaxGenerationMixin`].

Regardless of your framework of choice, you can parametrize the generate method with a [`~generation.GenerationConfig`]
class instance. Please refer to this class for the complete list of generation parameters, which control the behavior
of the generation method.

All models have a default generation configuration that will be used if you don't provide one. If you have a loaded
model instance `model`, you can inspect the default generation configuration with `model.generation_config`. If you'd
like to set a new default generation configuration, you can create a new [`~generation.GenerationConfig`] instance and
store it with `save_pretrained`, making sure to leave its `config_file_name` argument empty.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, GenerationConfig

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("my_account/my_model")

# Inspect the default generation configuration
print(model.generation_config)

# Set a new default generation configuration
generation_config = GenerationConfig(
    max_new_tokens=50, do_sample=True, top_k=50, eos_token_id=model.config.eos_token_id
)
generation_config.save_pretrained("my_account/my_model", push_to_hub=True)
```

<Tip>

If you inspect a serialized [`~generation.GenerationConfig`] file or print a class instance, you will notice that
default values are omitted. Some attributes, like `max_new_tokens`, have a conservative default value, to avoid running
into resource limitations. Make sure you double-check the defaults in the documentation.

</Tip>

You can also store several generation parametrizations in a single directory, making use of the `config_file_name`
argument in `save_pretrained`. You can latter instantiate them with `from_pretrained`. This is useful if you want to
store several generation configurations for a single model (e.g. one for creative text generation with sampling, and
other for summarization with beam search).

```python
from transformers import GenerationConfig

# Create a new generation configuration for later use
my_awesome_config = GenerationConfig(num_beams=8, do_sample=False, bad_words_ids=[[42, 43, 44]], eos_token_id=2)
my_awesome_config.save_pretrained(
    "my_account/my_model", config_file_name="awesome_generation_config.json", push_to_hub=True
)

# Restore the generation configuration
generation_config = GenerationConfig.from_pretrained(
    "my_account/my_model", config_file_name="awesome_generation_config.json"
)
```

Finally, you can specify ad hoc modifications to the used generation configuration by passing the attribute you
wish to override directly to the generate method (e.g. `model.generate(inputs, max_new_tokens=512)`). Each
framework's `generate` method docstring (available below) has a few illustrative examples on the different strategies
to parameterize it.
