# Efficient Training on CPU

This guide focuses on training large models efficiently on CPU.

## Mixed precision with IPEX

XXX: Explain what it is - if you have an Intel CPU ...

Install the correct IPEX version for the right pytorch version:

Find the correct version of the pytorch you will be running IPEX with here: https://software.intel.com/ipex-whl-stable

Now install it, e.g. for pytorch-1.10:

```
pip install intel_extension_for_pytorch==1.10.100+cpu -f https://software.intel.com/ipex-whl-stable
```

for pytorch-1.11:


```
pip install intel_extension_for_pytorch==1.11.0+cpu -f https://software.intel.com/ipex-whl-stable
```

To use: XXX
