# Agents

Large Language Models (LLMs) trained to perform [causal language modeling](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/tasks/language_modeling) can tackle a wide range of tasks, but they often struggle with basic tasks like logic, calculation, and search. The worst scenario is when they perform poorly in a domain, such as math, yet still attempt to handle all the calculations themselves.

One approach to overcome this weakness is to embed the LLM into a system where it has the ability to call tools: such a system is called an LLM Agent.

The augmentation with tools gives the LLM superpowers. See for yourselves:

```python
agent.run("Caption the following image", image=image)
```

```markdown
| **Input**                                                                                                                   | **Output**                        |

Here you will learn:

- what an agent is,
- how to build one using `transformers` ,
- and how to use it.

## Quickstart

### What is an agent?

The definition of LLM Agents is quite broad: all systems that use LLMs as their engine, and have access to functions called **tools**.

When trying to accomplish a task, an agent can be either programmed to:

- devise a series of actions/tool calls and run them all at once, like our `CodeAgent`
- or plan and execute them one by one to wait for the outcome of the each action before launching the next one, thus following a Reflexion ⇒ Action ⇒ Perception cycle. Our `ReactAgent` implements this latter framework.

![Framework of a React Agent](Doc%20agents%20ac753b9a3b934eaba22f659ba994c4bd/Untitled.png)

Read [our blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/open-source-llms-as-agents) to learn more.


Here is an example adapted from  showing how powerful the ReAct agent framework can be to solve problems: Mixtral-8x7B answers the question:

```
Task: How many more blocks (also denoted as layers) in BERT base encoder than the encoder from the architecture proposed in Attention is All You Need?

Thought: To begin, I need to find the number of layers in the encoder of BERT base and the architecture proposed in Attention is All You Need. I will start by searching for the number of layers in BERT base.

Action:
{
   "action": "search",
 "action_input": "number of layers in BERT base encoder"
}

Observation: 12 layers
Thought: I need to search for the number of layers in the encoder of the architecture proposed in Attention is All You Need.

Action:
{
   "action": "search",
 "action_input": "number of layers in the encoder of the architecture proposed in Attention is All You Need"
}

Observation: Encoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers.
Thought: Now that I have the number of layers for both BERT base and the architecture proposed in Attention is All You Need, I can calculate the difference.

Action:
{
   "action": "calculator",
 "action_input": "12 - 6"
}


Observation: 6
Thought: Now that I have the calculated difference, I need to provide the final answer.

Action:
{
   "action": "final_answer",
 "action_input": "BERT base encoder has 6 more layers than the encoder from the architecture proposed in Attention is All You Need"
}'

```


### What is a tool?

A tool is an atomic function to be used by an agent.

You can for instance check the [~CalculatorTool], which we use

It has a name, a description, input and output descriptions, and a __call__ method that will perform the action.

Upon initialization of the agent system, the tool attributes are used to generate a tool description, then baked into the agent’s `system_prompt`  to let it know which tools it can use and why.


### How can I build an agent?

To initialize an agent, you need these arguments:

- an LLM to power your agent - the agent is not exactly the LLM, it’s more like the agent is a program that uses an LLM as its engine.
- a system prompt: what the LLM engine will be prompted with to generate its output
- a toolbox from which the agent pick tools to execute
- a parser to extract from the LLM output which tools are to call and with which arguments

To start with, please install the `agents` extras in order to install all default dependencies.

```bash
pip install transformers[agents]
```

To build your LLM engine, you have to define a `llm_engine` method, that will be given text and return text. This callable needs to accept a `stop` argument defining stop sequences indicating when to stop generating its output. For instance as follows:

```python
from huggingface_hub import login, InferenceClient

login("<YOUR_HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN>")

client = InferenceClient(model="mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1")

def llm_engine(query: str, stop=["Task"]) -> str:
    response = client.text_generation(query, stop_sequences=stop, return_full_text=False, max_new_tokens=1000)
    for stop_seq in stop:
        if response[-len(stop_seq) :] == stop_seq:
            response = response[: -len(stop_seq)]
    return response
```

You could use any other `llm_engine` method, as long as:

- it takes a `str` as input and returns a `str`
- it will stop generating output _before_ the sequences passed in argument `stop`

You also need a `tools` argument, as a list of `Tools`. We can start with an empty one but specify `add_base_tools` to start from a default set of arguments.

Then you can define your agent and run it.

```python
from transformers import CodeAgent

agent = CodeAgent(llm_engine=llm_engine, tools=[], add_base_tools=True)

agent.run("Draw me a picture of rivers and lakes")
```

The prompt and output parser were automatically defined here, but you can easily inspect them.

![Untitled](Doc%20agents%20ac753b9a3b934eaba22f659ba994c4bd/Untitled%201.png)

```python
agent.prompt_template
```

Note that your agent is powered by a LLM, so small variations in your prompt might yield completely different results. It's important to explain as clearly as possible the task you want to perform. We go more in-depth on how to write good prompts [here](custom_tools#writing-good-user-inputs).

Every [`~Agent.run`] operation is independent, so you can run it several times in a row with different tasks.


## Implementation of agents

### ReactAgent

This is the go-to agent to solve reasoning tasks, since the ReAct framework makes it really efficient to think on the basis of its previous observations.

### CodeAgent

This class is the one to use when trying to execute multimodal tasks, since it natively handles different input and output types for its tools. It has a planning step, then generates python code to execute all actions at once.

#### Code execution?!

This code is then executed with our small Python interpreter on the set of inputs passed along with your tools. We hear you screaming "Arbitrary code execution!" in the back, but let us explain why that is not the case.

The only functions that can be called are the tools you provided and the print function, so you're already limited in what can be executed. You should be safe if it's limited to Hugging Face tools. 

Then, we don't allow any attribute lookup or imports (which shouldn't be needed anyway for passing along  inputs/outputs to a small set of functions) so all the most obvious attacks (and you'd need to prompt the LLM  to output them anyway) shouldn't be an issue.

The execution will stop at any line trying to perform an illegal operation or if there is a regular Python error with the code generated by the agent.

### Default toolbox

We curated a set of tools that can empower agents. Here is an updated list of the tools we have integrated in `transformers`:

- **Document question answering**: given a document (such as a PDF) in image format, answer a question on this document ([Donut](./model_doc/donut))
- **Text question answering**: given a long text and a question, answer the question in the text ([Flan-T5](./model_doc/flan-t5))
- **Unconditional image captioning**: Caption the image! ([BLIP](./model_doc/blip))
- **Image question answering**: given an image, answer a question on this image ([VILT](./model_doc/vilt))
- **Image segmentation**: given an image and a prompt, output the segmentation mask of that prompt ([CLIPSeg](./model_doc/clipseg))
- **Speech to text**: given an audio recording of a person talking, transcribe the speech into text ([Whisper](./model_doc/whisper))
- **Text to speech**: convert text to speech ([SpeechT5](./model_doc/speecht5))
- **Zero-shot text classification**: given a text and a list of labels, identify to which label the text corresponds the most ([BART](./model_doc/bart))
- **Text summarization**: summarize a long text in one or a few sentences ([BART](./model_doc/bart))
- **Translation**: translate the text into a given language ([NLLB](./model_doc/nllb))

These tools have an integration in transformers, and can be used manually as well, for example:

```python
from transformers import load_tool

tool = load_tool("text-to-speech")
audio = tool("This is a text to speech tool")
```

# Getting the best out of your agents

To be performant, your agents should be tailored to the task you intend to give them.

The things that you can easily customize in a `transformers` agent are:

- the system prompt
- the toolbox

We will now see how to optimize the usage of both of these!

## Customizing the prompt

As we’ve seen above, the LLM generates its output based on a prompt. Let’s take a look at our system prompt for the React agent:

```python
Solve the following task as best you can. You have access to the following tools:

<<tool_descriptions>>

The way you use the tools is by specifying a json blob.
Specifically, this json should have a `action` key (name of the tool to use) and a `action_input` key (input to the tool).

The value in the "action" field should belong to this list: <<tool_names>>.

The $ACTION_JSON_BLOB should only contain a SINGLE action, do NOT return a list of multiple actions. It should be formatted in json. Do not try to escape special characters. Here is an example of a valid $ACTION_JSON_BLOB:
Action:
{
  "action": $TOOL_NAME,
  "action_input": $INPUT
}

Make sure to have the $INPUT in the right format for the tool you are using, and do not put variable names as input if you can find the right values.

You will be given:

Task: the task you are given.

And you should ALWAYS answer in the following format:

Thought: you should always think about one action to take. Then use the action as follows:
Action:
$ACTION_JSON_BLOB
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed. The $ACTION_JSON_BLOB must only use a SINGLE action at a time.)

ALWAYS provide a 'Thought:' and an 'Action:' part. You MUST provide at least the 'Action:' part to move forward.
To provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with "action": 'final_answer' tool.It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:
{
  "action": 'final_answer',
  "action_input": "insert your final answer here"
}

Now begin!
```

The prompt has these parts:

- Introduction: how the agent should behave, explanation of the concept of tools.
- Description of all the tools. This is defined by a `<<tool_descriptions>>` token that is dynamically replaced at runtime with the tools defined/chosen by the user.
    - The description is built based on the tool attributes `name`, `description`, `inputs` and `output_type`  with a simple `jinja2` template, that you can refine.
- Clarifications on the output format
- Introduction of the task at hand.

This could be improved: for instance by adding explanations of the output format.

For maximum flexibility, you can overwrite the whole prompt template as explained above by passing your custom prompt as an argument:

```python
from transformers import ReactAgent
from transformers.tools import CalculatorTool

agent = ReactAgent(llm_engine, tools = [CalculatorTool()], system_prompt="{your_custom_prompt}")
```

<Tip warning={true}>

Please make sure to have the `<<all_tools>>` string defined somewhere in the `template` so that the agent can be aware 
of the tools, it has available to it.

</Tip>


## Adding new tools

In this section, we show how to create a new tool that can be added to the agent.

### Creating a new tool and sharing it to the Hub

We'll first start by creating a tool. We'll add the not-so-useful yet fun task of fetching the model on the Hugging Face
Hub with the most downloads for a given task.

We can do that with the following code:

```python
from huggingface_hub import list_models

task = "text-classification"

model = next(iter(list_models(filter=task, sort="downloads", direction=-1)))
print(model.id)
```

For the task `text-classification`, this returns `'facebook/bart-large-mnli'`, for `translation` it returns `'google-t5/t5-base`.

How do we convert this to a tool that the agent can leverage? All tools depend on the superclass `Tool` that holds the
main attributes necessary. We'll create a class that inherits from it:

```python
from transformers import Tool

class HFModelDownloadsTool(Tool):
    pass
```

This class has a few needs:
- An attribute `name`, which corresponds to the name of the tool itself. To be in tune with other tools which have a
  performative name, we'll name it `model_download_counter`.
- An attribute `description`, which will be used to populate the prompt of the agent.
- `inputs` attribute. This is a dictionnary with keys `"type"`and `"description"`containing information to help the python interpreter make educated choices about the input,
  and will allow for a gradio-demo to be spawned when we push our tool to the Hub.
- An attribute `output_type` specifying the type of the ouput. 
- A `__call__` method which contains the inference code. This is the code we've played with above!

Here's what our class looks like now:

```python
from transformers import Tool
from huggingface_hub import list_models

class HFModelDownloadsTool(Tool):
    name = "model_download_counter"
    description = (
        "This is a tool that returns the most downloaded model of a given task on the Hugging Face Hub. "
        "It returns the name of the checkpoint."
    )

    inputs = {
        "task": {
            "type": str,
            "description": "the task category (such as text-classification, depth-estimation, etc)",
        }
    }
    output_type = str

    def __call__(self, task: str):
        model = next(iter(list_models(filter=task, sort="downloads", direction=-1)))
        return model.id
```

We now have our tool handy. Save it in a file and import it from your main script. Let's name this file
`model_downloads.py`, so the resulting import code looks like this:

```python
from model_downloads import HFModelDownloadsTool

tool = HFModelDownloadsTool()
```

In order to let others benefit from it and for simpler initialization, we recommend pushing it to the Hub under your 
namespace. To do so, just call `push_to_hub` on the `tool` variable (be sure to have created the space beforehand, and to be authenticated with a token that has read access!)

```python
tool.push_to_hub("{your_username}/hf-model-downloads")
```

You now have your code on the Hub! Let's take a look at the final step, which is to have the agent use it.

### Initializing an agent that uses the tool

We now have our tool that lives on the Hub which can be instantiated as such (change the user name for your tool):

```python
from transformers import load_tool

model_download_tool = load_tool("m-ric/hf-model-downloads")
```

In order to use it in the agent, simply pass it to the agent initialization method.

```python
from transformers import CodeAgent

agent = CodeAgent(llm_engine, tools=[model_download_tool])

agent.run(
    "Can you give me the name of the model that has the most downloads in the 'text-to-video' task on the Hugging Face Hub?"
)
```
You get the following:
```text
==Executing the code below:==
task = 'text-to-video'
model_name = model_download_counter(task=task)
print(f"The most downloaded model in the '{task}' task is '{model_name}'.")
```

And the output:
`"The most downloaded model in the 'text-to-video' task is 'ByteDance/AnimateDiff-Lightning'."`



<Tip>

Depending on the LLM, some are quite brittle and require very exact prompts in order to work well. Having a well-defined
name and description of the tool is paramount to having it be leveraged by the agent.

</Tip>

### Adding a new tool to an existing agent's toolbox

If you have alread initialized an agent, it can be heavy to have to reinitialize it from scratch with your desired set of tools.

So you can also directly add a new tool to the toolbox of an existing agent, or even replace an existing tool.

Let's try to add our `model_download_tool` to an existing agent that we initialized with only the base tools:

```python
from transformers import CodeAgent

agent = CodeAgent(llm_engine, tools=[], add_base_tools=True)
agent.toolbox.add_tool(model_download_tool)
```
Now we can leverage both the new tool and the previous text-to-speech tool:

```python
agent.run(
    "Can you read out loud the name of the model that has the most downloads in the 'text-to-video' task on the Hugging Face Hub?"
)
```

this generates the following audio.

| **Audio**                                                                                                                                            |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <audio controls><source src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/damo.wav" type="audio/wav"/> |


<Tip>

The agent's prompt will reflect the new tool description. But beware when adding tools to an agent that already works well!
It can result in your tool being selected way more than others or for other
tools to be selected instead of the one you have defined.

</Tip>


### Replacing an existing tool in the agent's toolbox

Replacing existing tools can be done simply by updating the agent's toolbox using method `agent.toolbox.update_tool()`.


<Tip>

Overwriting existing tools can be beneficial if we want to use a custom tool exactly for the same task as an existing tool 
because the agent is well-versed in using the specific task. Beware that the custom tool should follow the exact same API 
as the overwritten tool in this case, or you should adapt the prompt template to make sure all examples using that
tool are updated.

</Tip>



### Leveraging gradio-tools

[gradio-tools](https://github.com/freddyaboulton/gradio-tools) is a powerful library that allows using Hugging
Face Spaces as tools. It supports many existing Spaces as well as custom Spaces to be designed with it.

We offer support for `gradio_tools` by using the `Tool.from_gradio` method. For example, we want to take
advantage of the `StableDiffusionPromptGeneratorTool` tool offered in the `gradio-tools` toolkit so as to
improve our prompts and generate better images.

We first import the tool from `gradio_tools` and instantiate it:

```python
from gradio_tools import StableDiffusionPromptGeneratorTool

gradio_tool = StableDiffusionPromptGeneratorTool()
```

We pass that instance to the `Tool.from_gradio` method:

```python
from transformers import Tool

tool = Tool.from_gradio(gradio_tool)
```

Now we can manage it exactly as we would a usual custom tool. We leverage it to improve our prompt
` a rabbit wearing a space suit`:

```python
from transformers import CodeAgent

agent = CodeAgent(llm_engine, tools=[tool], add_base_tools=True)

agent.run(
    "Improve this prompt: 'A rabbit wearing a space suit', then generate an image of it.",
)
```

The model adequately leverages the tool:
```text
==Explanation from the agent==
I will use the following  tools: `StableDiffusionPromptGenerator` to improve the prompt, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the improved prompt.

==Code generated by the agent==
improved_prompt = StableDiffusionPromptGenerator('A rabbit wearing a space suit')
print(f"The improved prompt is {improved_prompt}.")
image = image_generator(improved_prompt)
```

Before finally generating the image:

<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/rabbit.png">

<Tip warning={true}>

gradio-tools requires *textual* inputs and outputs, even when working with different modalities. This implementation
works with image and audio objects. The two are currently incompatible, but will rapidly become compatible as we
work to improve the support.

</Tip>

### Importing tools from LangChain

You can also use method `from_langchain`to quickly initialize a tool from a LangChain tool.
This goes as follows: 

```python
# Load langchain tool
from langchain_community.tools import WikipediaQueryRun
from langchain_community.utilities import WikipediaAPIWrapper

api_wrapper = WikipediaAPIWrapper(top_k_results=1, doc_content_chars_max=100)
langchain_tool = WikipediaQueryRun(api_wrapper=api_wrapper)

# Initialize transformers tool from langchain tool
from transformers.tools.base import Tool

tool = Tool.from_langchain(langchain_tool)
```
