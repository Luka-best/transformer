# MusicGen

## Overview

The MusicGen model was proposed in the paper [Simple and Controllable Music Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05284)
by Jade Copet, Felix Kreuk, Itai Gat, Tal Remez, David Kant, Gabriel Synnaeve, Yossi Adi and Alexandre DÃ©fossez.

MusicGen is a single stage auto-regressive Transformer model capable of generating high-quality music samples conditioned
on text descriptions or audio prompts. It is trained to predict four discrete codebooks that are decoded using the Encodec
audio compression model.

Through an efficient token interleaving pattern, MusicGen does not require a self-supervised semantic representation of
the text/audio prompts, thus eliminating the need to cascade multiple models to predict a set of codebooks (e.g.
hierarchically or upsampling). Instead, it is able to generate all four codebooks in a single forward pass.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*We tackle the task of conditional music generation. We introduce MusicGen, a single Language Model (LM) that operates
over several streams of compressed discrete music representation, i.e., tokens. Unlike prior work, MusicGen is comprised
of a single-stage transformer LM together with efficient token interleaving patterns, which eliminates the need for
cascading several models, e.g., hierarchically or upsampling. Following this approach, we demonstrate how MusicGen
can generate high-quality samples, while being conditioned on textual description or melodic features, allowing better
controls over the generated output. We conduct extensive empirical evaluation, considering both automatic and human
studies, showing the proposed approach is superior to the evaluated baselines on a standard text-to-music benchmark.
Through ablation studies, we shed light over the importance of each of the components comprising MusicGen.*

Tips:
* MusicGen is trained on the 32kHz checkpoint of Encodec. You should ensure you use a compatible version of the Encodec model.
