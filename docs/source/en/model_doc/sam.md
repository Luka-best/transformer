# SAM

## Overview

SAM (Segment Anything Model) was proposed in [Segment Anything](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.02643v1.pdf) by Alexander Kirillov, Eric Mintun, Nikhila Ravi, Hanzi Mao, Chloe Rolland, Laura Gustafson, Tete Xiao, Spencer Whitehead, Alex Berg, Wan-Yen Lo, Piotr Dollar, Ross Girshick.

The model can be used to predict segmentation masks of any object of interest given an input image.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*We introduce the Segment Anything (SA) project: a new task, model, and dataset for image segmentation. Using our efficient model in a data collection loop, we built the largest segmentation dataset to date (by far), with over 1 billion masks on 11M licensed and privacy respecting images. The model is designed and trained to be promptable, so it can transfer zero-shot to new image distributions and tasks. We evaluate its capabilities on numerous tasks and find that its zero-shot performance is impressive -- often competitive with or even superior to prior fully supervised results. We are releasing the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and corresponding dataset (SA-1B) of 1B masks and 11M images at [https://segment-anything.com](https://segment-anything.com) to foster research into foundation models for computer vision.*

Tips:

- The model predicts binary masks that states the presence or not of the object of interest given an image.
- The model predicts much better results if input 2D points and/or input bounding boxes are provided
- You can prompt multiple points for the same image, and predict a single mask. 
- Fine-tuning the model is not supported yet
- According to the paper, textual input should be also supported. However, at this time of writing this seems not to be supported according to [the official repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything/issues/4#issuecomment-1497626844). 


This model was contributed by [ybelkada](https://huggingface.co/ybelkada) and [ArthurZ](https://huggingface.co/ArthurZ).
The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything).

Below is an example on how to run mask generation given an image and a 2D point:

```python
import torch
from PIL import Image
import requests
from transformers import SamModel, SamProcessor

device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
model = SamModel.from_pretrained("facebook/sam-vit-huge").to(device)
processor = SamProcessor.from_pretrained("facebook/sam-vit-huge")

img_url = "https://huggingface.co/ybelkada/segment-anything/resolve/main/assets/car.png"
raw_image = Image.open(requests.get(img_url, stream=True).raw).convert("RGB")
input_points = [[[450, 600]]]  # 2D location of a window in the image

inputs = processor(raw_image, input_points=input_points, return_tensors="pt").to(device)
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)

masks = processor.image_processor.post_process_masks(
    outputs.pred_masks.cpu(), inputs["original_sizes"].cpu(), inputs["reshaped_input_sizes"].cpu()
)
scores = outputs.iou_scores
```

You can also process your own masks alongside the input images in the processor to be passed to the model.

```python
import torch
from PIL import Image
import requests
from transformers import SamModel, SamProcessor

device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
model = SamModel.from_pretrained("facebook/sam-vit-huge").to(device)
processor = SamProcessor.from_pretrained("facebook/sam-vit-huge")

img_url = "https://huggingface.co/ybelkada/segment-anything/resolve/main/assets/car.png"
raw_image = Image.open(requests.get(img_url, stream=True).raw).convert("RGB")
mask_url = "https://huggingface.co/ybelkada/segment-anything/resolve/main/assets/car.png"
segmentation_map = Image.open(requests.get(mask_url, stream=True).raw).convert("1")
input_points = [[[450, 600]]]  # 2D location of a window in the image

inputs = processor(raw_image, input_points=input_points, segmentation_maps=segmentation_map, return_tensors="pt").to(device)
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)

masks = processor.image_processor.post_process_masks(
    outputs.pred_masks.cpu(), inputs["original_sizes"].cpu(), inputs["reshaped_input_sizes"].cpu()
)
scores = outputs.iou_scores
```

## SlimSAM

SlimSAM, a pruned version of SAM, was proposed in [0.1% Data Makes Segment Anything Slim](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05284) by Zigeng Chen et al. SlimSAM reduces the size of the SAM models considerably while maintaining the same performance.

Checkpoints can be found on the [hub](https://huggingface.co/models?other=slimsam), and they can be used as a drop-in replacement of SAM.

## Grounded SAM

One can combine [Grounding DINO](grounding-dino) with SAM for text-based mask generation as introduced in [Grounded SAM: Assembling Open-World Models for Diverse Visual Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14159). You can refer to this [demo notebook](https://github.com/NielsRogge/Transformers-Tutorials/blob/master/Grounding%20DINO/GroundingDINO_with_Segment_Anything.ipynb) üåç for details.

## Advanced Usage
### Customizing the Attention Mechanism in SAM
The Segment Anything Model (SAM) uses a combined query-key-value (qkv) projection in its attention mechanism by default. For advanced applications, you might want to modify individual components of the attention mechanism‚Äîsuch as applying LoRA to only the query or value projections without affecting the key projection.
Below is an example of how to modify the `SamVisionAttention` class to split the combined `qkv` projection:

```python
from transformers.models.sam.modeling_sam import SamVisionAttention, SamModel, SamVisionLayer
import torch.nn as nn
import torch
from transformers.models.sam import modeling_sam

class SamVisionAttentionSplit(SamVisionAttention, nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, config, window_size):
        super().__init__(config, window_size)
        del self.qkv
        # Separate q, k, v projections
        self.q = nn.Linear(config.hidden_size, config.hidden_size, bias=config.qkv_bias)
        self.k = nn.Linear(config.hidden_size, config.hidden_size, bias=config.qkv_bias)
        self.v = nn.Linear(config.hidden_size, config.hidden_size, bias=config.qkv_bias)
        self._register_load_state_dict_pre_hook(self.split_q_k_v_load_hook)

    def split_q_k_v_load_hook(self, state_dict, prefix, *args):
        keys_to_delete = []
        for key in list(state_dict.keys()):
            if "qkv." in key:
                # Split q, k, v from the combined projection
                q, k, v = state_dict[key].chunk(3, dim=0)
                # Replace with individual q, k, v projections
                state_dict[key.replace("qkv.", "q.")] = q
                state_dict[key.replace("qkv.", "k.")] = k
                state_dict[key.replace("qkv.", "v.")] = v
                # Mark the old qkv key for deletion
                keys_to_delete.append(key)
        
        # Remove old qkv keys
        for key in keys_to_delete:
            del state_dict[key]

    def forward(self, hidden_states: torch.Tensor, output_attentions=False) -> torch.Tensor:
        batch_size, height, width, _ = hidden_states.shape
        qkv_shapes = (batch_size *  self.num_attention_heads,  height * width, -1)
        query = self.q(hidden_states).reshape((batch_size,  height * width,self.num_attention_heads, -1)).permute(0,2,1,3).reshape(qkv_shapes)
        key = self.k(hidden_states).reshape((batch_size,  height * width,self.num_attention_heads, -1)).permute(0,2,1,3).reshape(qkv_shapes)
        value = self.v(hidden_states).reshape((batch_size,  height * width,self.num_attention_heads, -1)).permute(0,2,1,3).reshape(qkv_shapes)

        attn_weights = (query * self.scale) @ key.transpose(-2, -1)

        if self.use_rel_pos:
            attn_weights = self.add_decomposed_rel_pos(
                attn_weights, query, self.rel_pos_h, self.rel_pos_w, (height, width), (height, width)
            )

        attn_weights = torch.nn.functional.softmax(attn_weights, dtype=torch.float32, dim=-1).to(query.dtype)
        attn_probs = nn.functional.dropout(attn_weights, p=self.dropout, training=self.training)
        attn_output = (attn_probs @ value).reshape(batch_size, self.num_attention_heads, height, width, -1)
        attn_output = attn_output.permute(0, 2, 3, 1, 4).reshape(batch_size, height, width, -1)
        attn_output = self.proj(attn_output)

        if output_attentions:
            outputs = (attn_output, attn_weights)
        else:
            outputs = (attn_output, None)
        return outputs

# Replace the attention class
modeling_sam.SamVisionAttention = SamVisionAttentionSplit
```

**Warning**

When using this custom implementation, you may see a warning related to weight initialization. This is expected due to the separation of the qkv projections. You can safely ignore this warning.
