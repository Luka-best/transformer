# SuperGlue

## Overview

The SuperGlue model was proposed
in [SuperPoint: Self-Supervised Interest Point Detection and Description](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07629) by Daniel
DeTone, Tomasz Malisiewicz and Andrew Rabinovich.
<INSERT SHORT SUMMARY HERE>

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*This paper presents a self-supervised framework for training interest point detectors and descriptors suitable for a
large number of multiple-view geometry problems in computer vision. As opposed to patch-based neural networks, our
fully-convolutional model operates on full-sized images and jointly computes pixel-level interest point locations and
associated descriptors in one forward pass. We introduce Homographic Adaptation, a multi-scale, multi-homography
approach for boosting interest point detection repeatability and performing cross-domain adaptation (e.g.,
synthetic-to-real). Our model, when trained on the MS-COCO generic image dataset using Homographic Adaptation, is able
to repeatedly detect a much richer set of interest points than the initial pre-adapted deep model and any other
traditional corner detector. The final system gives rise to state-of-the-art homography estimation results on HPatches
when compared to LIFT, SIFT and ORB.*
