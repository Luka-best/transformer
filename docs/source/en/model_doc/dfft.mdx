## Overview

Vision transformers (ViTs) are changing the landscape of object detection approaches. A natural usage of ViTs
in detection is to replace the CNN-based backbone with a transformer-based backbone, which is straightforward
and effective, with the price of bringing considerable computation burden for inference.To overcome these issues, we propose a novel decoder-free fully transformerbased (DFFT) object detector, achieving high efficiency in
both training and inference stages, for the first time. It simpliflies objection detection into an encoder-only singlelevel anchor-based dense prediction problem by centering around two entry points:




If you're interested in submitting a resource to be included here, please feel free to open a Pull Request and we'll review it! The resource should ideally demonstrate something new instead of duplicating an existing resource.
