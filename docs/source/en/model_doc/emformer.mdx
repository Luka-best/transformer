# Emformer

## Overview

The Emformer model was proposed in [Emformer: Efficient Memory Transformer Based Acoustic Model For Low Latency
Streaming Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10759) by Yangyang Shi, Yongqiang Wang, Chunyang Wu,
Ching-Feng Yeh, Julian Chan, Frank Zhang, Duc Le, Mike Seltzer.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

This paper proposes an efficient memory transformer Emformer for low latency streaming speech recognition. In Emformer,
the long-range history context is distilled into an augmented memory bank to reduce self-attention's computation
complexity. A cache mechanism saves the computation for the key and value in self-attention for the left context.
Emformer applies a parallelized block processing in training to support low latency models. We carry out experiments
on benchmark LibriSpeech data. Under average latency of 960 ms, Emformer gets WER 2.50% on test-clean and 5.62% on
test-other. Comparing with a strong baseline augmented memory transformer (AM-TRF), Emformer gets 4.6 folds training
speedup and 18% relative real-time factor (RTF) reduction in decoding with relative WER reduction 17% on test-clean
and 9% on test-other. For a low latency scenario with an average latency of 80 ms, Emformer achieves WER 3.01% on
test-clean and 7.09% on test-other. Comparing with the LSTM baseline with the same latency and model size, Emformer
gets relative WER reduction 9% and 16% on test-clean and test-other, respectively.
