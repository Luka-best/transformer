# GLM

## Overview

The GLM model was proposed in [GLM: General Language Model Pretraining with Autoregressive Blank Infilling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10360)
by Zhengxiao Du, Yujie Qian, Xiao Liu, Ming Ding, Jiezhong Qiu, Zhilin Yang, Jie Tang.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*There have been various types of pretraining architectures including autoencoding models (e.g., BERT), autoregressive
models (e.g., GPT), and encoder-decoder models (e.g., T5). However, none of the pretraining frameworks performs
the best for all tasks of three main categories including natural language understanding (NLU), unconditional generation,
and conditional generation. We propose a General Language Model (GLM) based on autoregressive blank infilling to address
this challenge. GLM improves blank filling pretraining by adding 2D positional encodings and allowing an arbitrary
order to predict spans, which results in performance gains over BERT and T5 on NLU tasks. Meanwhile, GLM can be pretrained
for different types of tasks by varying the number and lengths of blanks. On a wide range of tasks across NLU, conditional
and unconditional generation, GLM outperforms BERT, T5, and GPT given the same model sizes and data, and achieves the
best performance from a single pretrained model with 1.25x parameters of BERT Large , demonstrating its generalizability
to different downstream tasks.*
