# Convolutional Vision Transformer (LeViT)

## Overview

The LeViT model was proposed in [LeViT: Introducing Convolutions to Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01136) by Ben Graham, Alaaeldin El-Nouby, Hugo Touvron, Pierre Stock, Armand Joulin, Hervé Jégou, Matthijs Douze. The LeViT improves the [Vision Transformer (ViT)](vit) in performance and efficiency by few architectural differences such as the activation maps with decreasing resolutions in transformers and introduction of attention bias to integrate positional information.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*We design a family of image classification architectures that optimize the trade-off between accuracy
and efficiency in a high-speed regime. Our work exploits recent findings in attention-based architectures, 
which are competitive on highly parallel processing hardware. We revisit principles from the extensive 
literature on convolutional neural networks to apply them to transformers, in particular activation maps 
with decreasing resolutions. We also introduce the attention bias, a new way to integrate positional information
in vision transformers. As a result, we propose LeVIT: a hybrid neural network for fast inference image classification. 
We consider different measures of efficiency on different hardware platforms, so as to best reflect a wide range of 
application scenarios. Our extensive experiments empirically validate our technical choices and show they are suitable 
to most architectures. Overall, LeViT significantly outperforms existing convnets and vision transformers with respect 
to the speed/accuracy tradeoff. For example, at 80% ImageNet top-1 accuracy, LeViT is 5 times faster than EfficientNet on CPU. *

Tips:

- LeViT models are regular Vision Transformers, with few architectural differences such as the activation maps with decreasing resolutions in transformers and introduction of attention bias to integrate positional information. They outperform the [original model (ViT)](vit) when fine-tuned on ImageNet-1K.
- You can check out demo notebooks regarding inference as well as fine-tuning on custom data [here](https://github.com/NielsRogge/Transformers-Tutorials/tree/master/VisionTransformer) (you can just replace [`ViTFeatureExtractor`] by [`LevitFeatureExtractor`] and [`ViTForImageClassification`] by [`LevitForImageClassification`]).
- The available checkpoints are either (1) pre-trained on [ImageNet-22k](http://www.image-net.org/) (a collection of 14 million images and 22k classes) only, (2) also fine-tuned on ImageNet-22k or (3) also fine-tuned on [ImageNet-1k](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/) (also referred to as ILSVRC 2012, a collection of 1.3 million
  images and 1,000 classes).
