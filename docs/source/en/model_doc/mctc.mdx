# MCTC

## Overview

The MCTC model was proposed in [Pseudo-Labeling For Massively Multilingual Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00161) by Loren Lugosch, Tatiana Likhomanenko, Gabriel Synnaeve, and Ronan Collobert. 
<INSERT SHORT SUMMARY HERE>

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Semi-supervised learning through pseudo-labeling has become a staple of state-of-the-art monolingual
speech recognition systems. In this work, we extend pseudo-labeling to massively multilingual speech
recognition with 60 languages. We propose a simple pseudo-labeling recipe that works well even
with low-resource languages: train a supervised multilingual model, fine-tune it with semi-supervised
learning on a target language, generate pseudo-labels for that language, and train a final model using
pseudo-labels for all languages, either from scratch or by fine-tuning. Experiments on the labeled
Common Voice and unlabeled VoxPopuli datasets show that our recipe can yield a model with better
performance for many languages that also transfers well to LibriSpeech.*
