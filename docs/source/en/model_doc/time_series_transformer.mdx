# Time Series Transformer

## Overview

The Time Series Transformer model is a vanilla encoder-decoder Transformer for time series forecasting and classification.

Tips:

- The model is trained using "teacher-forcing", similar to machine translation. This means that, during training, one provides the ground truth
previous targets to the model rather than the model's predictions in order to predict the next target. Only at inference time, we sample from the model
to make a prediction at each time step, which is then fed to the model in order to make the next prediction (also called autoregressive generation).
