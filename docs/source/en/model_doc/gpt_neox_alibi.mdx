# GPT-NeoX-ALiBi

## Overview

This is exactly like the original [GPTNeoX](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/gpt_neox), the only difference being the use of the [ALiBi Positional Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12409).
This allows for the possibility on evaluating on sequences longer than those seen during training.
Models trained with ALiBi using the GPT NeoX library [https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox) should use this model class.
