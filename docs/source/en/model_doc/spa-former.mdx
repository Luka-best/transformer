# SpA-Former

## Overview

The SpA-Former was actually proposed in [SpA-Former:Transformer image shadow detection and removal via spatial attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10910.pdf)
by researchers of School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shang hai, China

The abstract from the paper is following:
In this paper, we propose an end-to-end SpA-Former to recover a shadow-free image from a single shaded image.
Unlike traditional methods that require two steps for shadow detection and then shadow removal, the SpA-Former unifies
these steps into one, which is a one-stage network capable of directly learning the mapping function between shadows
and no shadows, it does not require a separate shadow detection. Thus, SpA-former is adaptable to real image
de-shadowing for shadows projected on different semantic regions. SpA-Former consists of transformer layer and a series
of joint Fourier transform residual blocks and two-wheel joint spatial attention. The network in this paper is able to
handle the task while achieving a very fast processing efficiency.
