# TVP

## Overview

The TVP model was proposed in [Text-Visual Prompting for Efficient 2D Temporal Video Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14156) by Yimeng Zhang, Xin Chen, Jinghan Jia, Sijia Liu, Ke Ding. The goal of
this model is to incorporate trainable prompts into both visual inputs and textual features to temporal video grounding(TVG) problems, so we need no more compute-heavy 3D visual encoders and still get SOTA
accuracy on TVG tasks which predicts the interval of clips which was described by a text sentence within a long untrimmed video.

The paper has been accepted to the [CVPR'23](https://cvpr2023.thecvf.com/) conference.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*In this paper, we study the problem of temporal video grounding (TVG), which aims to predict the starting/ending time points of moments described by a text sentence within a long untrimmed video. Benefiting
from fine-grained 3D visual features, the TVG techniques have achieved remarkable progress in recent years. However, the high complexity of 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) makes extracting dense 3D
visual features time-consuming, which calls for intensive memory and computing resources. Towards efficient TVG, we propose a novel text-visual prompting (TVP) framework, which incorporates optimized
perturbation patterns (that we call ‘prompts’) into both visual inputs and textual features of a TVG model. In sharp contrast to 3D CNNs, we show that TVP allows us to effectively co-train vision encoder
and language encoder in a 2D TVG model and improves the performance of cross-modal feature fusion using only low-complexity sparse 2D visual features. Further, we propose a Temporal-Distance
IoU (TDIoU) loss for efficient learning of TVG. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions datasets, empirically show that the proposed TVP significantly boosts
the performance of 2D TVG (e.g., 9.79% improvement on Charades-STA and 30.77% improvement on ActivityNet Captions) and achieves 5× inference acceleration over TVG using 3D visual features.*

## Usage

TVP consists of a visual encoder and cross-modal encoder, and also textual prompt and visual prompt.
The goal of this model is to incorporate trainable prompts into both visual inputs and textual features to temporal video grounding(TVG) problems.
In principle, one can apply any visual, cross-modal encoder in the proposed architecture.

The [`TVPProcessor`] wraps [`BertTokenizer`] and [`TVPImageProcessor`] into a single instance to both
encode the text and prepare the images respectively.

The following example shows how to run temporal video grounding using [`TVPProcessor`] and [`TVPModel`].
```python

        fps (float): the number of frames per second of the video.
