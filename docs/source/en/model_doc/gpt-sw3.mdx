# GPT-Sw3

## Overview

The GPT-Sw3 model was first proposed in
[Lessons Learned from GPT-SW3: Building the First Large-Scale Generative Language Model for Swedish](http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2022/pdf/2022.lrec-1.376.pdf)
by Ariel Ekgren, Amaru Cuba Gyllensten, Evangelia Gogoulou, Alice Heiman, Severine Verlinden, Joey Ã–hman,
Fredrik Carlsson, Magnus Sahlgren.

Since that first paper the authors have extended thier work and trained new models on their new 1.2TB corpora named The Nordic Pile.

GPT-SW3 is a collection of large decoder-only pretrained transformer language models that were developed by AI Sweden
in collaboration with RISE and the WASP WARA for Media and Language. GPT-SW3 has been trained on a dataset containing
320B tokens in Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Icelandic, English, and programming code. The model was pretrained using a
causal language modeling (CLM) objective utilizing the NeMo Megatron GPT implementation.

This model was contributed by [AI Sweden](https://huggingface.co/AI-Sweden).
