# GPT-NeoX

## Overview

The GPT-NeoX-20B model was released in the [EleutherAI/gpt-neox](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox) repository.
It is a GPT-2 like causal language model trained on the
[Pile](https://pile.eleuther.ai/) dataset.

Development of the model was led by Sid Black, Stella Biderman and Eric Hallahan, and the model was trained with generous the support of [CoreWeave](https://www.coreweave.com/).
More details about the model can be found in the [manuscript](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06745).

### Generation

The `generate()` method can be used to generate text using GPT Neo model.

```python
>>> from transformers import GPTNeoXForCausalLM, GPTNeoXTokenizer

>>> model = GPTNeoXForCausalLM.from_pretrained("EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b")
>>> tokenizer = GPTNeoXTokenizer.from_pretrained("EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b")

>>> prompt = (
...     "In a shocking finding, scientists discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, "
...     "previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the "
...     "researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English."
... )

>>> input_ids = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").input_ids

>>> gen_tokens = model.generate(
...     input_ids,
...     do_sample=True,
...     temperature=0.9,
...     max_length=100,
... )
>>> gen_text = tokenizer.batch_decode(gen_tokens)[0]
```
