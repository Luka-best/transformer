# Transformers Agent

<Tip warning={true}>

Transformers Agent is an experimental API which is subject to change at any time. Results returned by the agents
can vary as the APIs or underlying models are prone to change.

</Tip>

Transformers version v4.30.0 introduces a new API, building on the concept of *tools* and *agents*.

In short, it provides a natural language API on top of transformers: we define a set of curated tools, and design an 
agent to interpret natural language and to use these tools. It is extensible by design; we curated some relevant tools, 
but we'll show you how the system can be extended easily to use any tool developed by the community.

Let's start with a few examples of what can be achieved with this new API. It is particularly powerful when it comes 
to multimodal tasks, so let's take it for a spin to generate images and read text out loud.

```py
agent.run("Caption the following image", image=image)
```

| **Input**                                                                                                                   | **Output**                        |

```py
agent.run("Read the following text out loud", text=text)
```
| **Input**                                                                                                               | **Output**                                   |

## Quickstart

Before being able to use `agent.run`, you will need to instantiate an agent, which is a large language model (LLM). 
We recommend using the [bigcode/starcoder](https://huggingface.co/bigcode/starcoder) checkpoint as it works very well 
for the task at hand and is open-source, but please find other examples below.

Start by logging-in to have access to the Inference API:

```py
from huggingface_hub import login

login("<YOUR_TOKEN>")
```

Then, instantiate the agent

```py
from transformers.tools import HfAgent

agent = HfAgent("https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/bigcode/starcoder")
```

This is using the inference API that Hugging Face provides for free at the moment, if you have your own inference
endpoint for this model (or another one) you can replace the url above by your url endpoint.

You're now good to go! Let's dive into the two APIs that you now have at your disposal.

### Single execution (run)

The single execution method is when using the [`~Agent.run`] method of the agent:

```py
agent.run("Draw me a picture of rivers and lakes")
```

<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/rivers_and_lakes.png" width=200>

It automatically select the tool (or tools) appropriate for the task you want to perform and run them appropriately. It
can perform one or several tasks in the same instruction (though the more complex your instruction, the more likely
the agent is to fail).

```py
agent.chat("Draw me a picture of the sea then transform the picture to add an island.")
```

<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/sea_and_island.png" width=200>

<br/>


Every [`~Agent.run`] operation is independent, so you can run it several times in a row with different tasks.

Note that your `agent` is just a large-language model, so small variations in your prompt might yield completely
different results. It's important to explain as clearly as possible the task you want to perform.

<Tip>

We're showcasing StarCoder as the default in the documentation as the model is free to use and performs admirably well
on simple tasks. However, the checkpoint doesn't hold up when handling more complex prompts. If you're facing such an
issue, we recommend trying out the OpenAI model which, while sadly not open-source, performs better at this given time.

</Tip>

### Chat-based execution (chat)

The agent also has a chat-based approach, using the [`~Agent.chat`] method:

```py
agent.chat("Draw me a picture of rivers and lakes")
```

<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/rivers_and_lakes.png" width=200> 

```py
agent.chat("Transform the picture so that there is a rock in there")
```

<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/rivers_and_lakes_and_beaver.png" width=200>

<br/>

This is an interesting approach when you want to keep the state across instructions. It's better for experimentation, 
but will tend to be much better at single instructions rather than complex instructions (which the [`~Agent.run`]
method is better at handling).

### ⚠️ Remote execution

For demonstration purposes and so that this can be used with all setups, we have created remote executors for several 
of the default tools the agent has access to. These are created using 
[inference endpoints](https://huggingface.co/inference-endpoints). To see how to setup remote executors tools yourself,
we recommend reading the custom tool guide [TODO LINK].

In order to run with remote tools, specifying `remote=True` to either [`~Agent.run`] or [`~Agent.chat`] is sufficient.

For example, the following command could be run on any device efficiently, without needing significant RAM or GPU:

```python
agent.run("Draw me a picture of rivers and lakes", remote=True)
```

The same can be said for [`~Agent.chat`]:

```py
agent.chat("Draw me a picture of rivers and lakes", remote=True)
```

### What's happening here? What are tools, and what are agents?

The "agent" here is a large language model, and we're prompting it so that it has access to a specific set of tools.

Tools are very simple: they're a single function, with a name, and a description. We then use these tools description 
to prompt the agent. Through the prompt, we show the agent how it would leverage tools in order to perform what was 
requests in the query.

### A curated set of tools

We identify a set of tools that can empower such agents. Here is an updated list of the tools we have integrated 
in `transformers`:

- **Document question answering**: given a document (such as a PDF) in image format, answer a question on this document ([Donut](../model_doc/donut))
- **Text question answering**: given a long text and a question, answer the question in the text ([Flan-T5](../model_doc/flan-t5))
- **Unconditional image captioning**: Caption the image! ([BLIP](../model_doc/blip))
- **Image question answering**: given an image, answer a question on this image ([VILT](../model_doc/vilt))
- **Image segmentation**: given an image and a prompt, output the segmentation mask of that prompt ([CLIPSeg](../model_doc/clipseg))
- **Speech to text**: given an audio recording of a person talking, transcribe the speech into text ([Whisper](../model_doc/whisper))
- **Text to speech**: convert text to speech ([SpeechT5](../model_doc/speecht5))
- **Zero-shot text classification**: given a text and a list of labels, identify to which label the text corresponds the most ([BART](../model_doc/bart))
- **Text summarization**: summarize a long text in one or a few sentences ([BART](../model_doc/bart))
- **Translation**: translate the text into a given language ([NLLB](../model_doc/nllb))

These tools have an integration in transformers, and can be used manually as well, for example:

```py
from transformers import load_tool

tool = load_tool("text-to-speech")
audio = tool("This is a text to speech tool")
```

### Custom tools

While we identify a curated set of tools, we strongly believe that the main value provided by this implementation is 
the ability to quickly create and share custom tools.

By pushing the code of a tool to a Hugging Face Space or a model repository, you're then able to leverage the tool 
directly with the agent. For demonstration purposes (and because they're super powerful), we've pushed a few 
transformers-agnostic tools in the `huggingface-tools` organization:

- **Text downloader**: to download a text from a web URL
- **Text to image**: generate an image according to a prompt, leveraging stable diffusion
- **Image transformation**: TODO
- **Image inpainting**: TODO

The text-to-image tool we have been using since the beginning is actually a remote tool that lives in 
[*huggingface-tools/text-to-image*](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface-tools/text-to-image)! We will
continue releasing such tools on this and other organization, to further supercharge this implementation.

We explain how to write and push to the Hub your own tools to the Hub in order to leverage them in the
[following guide](custom_tools).

### Leveraging different agents

We showcase here how to use the [bigcode/starcoder](https://huggingface.co/bigcode/starcoder) model as an LLM, but 
it isn't the only model available. We also support the OpenAssistant model and OpenAI's davinci models (3.5 and 4).

We're planning on supporting local language models in an ulterior version.

The tools defined in this implementation are agnostic to the agent used; we are showcasing the agents that work with 
our prompts below, but the tools can also be used with Langchain, Minichain, or any other Agent-based library.

#### Example code for the OpenAssistant model

```py
from transformers import HfAgent

agent = HfAgent(url_endpoint="https://open-assistant.ngrok.io", token="<HF_TOKEN>")
```

#### Example code for OpenAI models

```py
from transformers import OpenAiAgent

agent = OpenAiAgent(model="text-davinci-003", api_key="<API_KEY>")
```

### Code generation

So far we have shown how to use the agents to perform actions for you. However, the agent is really only generating code
that we then execute using a very restricted Python interpreter. In case you would like to use the code generated in 
a different setting, the agent can be prompted to return the code, along with tool definition and accurate imports.

For example, the following instruction
```python
agent.run("Draw me a picture of rivers and lakes", return_code=True)
```

returns the following code

```python
from transformers import load_tool

image_generator = load_tool("huggingface-tools/text-to-image")

image = image_generator(prompt="rivers and lakes")
```

### Custom prompts

The performance of the agent is directly linked to the prompt itself. We structure the prompt so that it works well 
with what we intend for the agent to do; but for maximum customization we also offer the ability to specify a different prompt when instantiating the agent.

The agent has two prompts: one for the `.run` method, and one for the `.chat` method. Both are customizable.

Here is how the two prompts are structured, and how to update them:

#### Single-execution prompt

The single-execution prompt is defined as such:
- Introduction: how the agent should behave, explanation of the concept of tools. Mentions to the agent that it should 
  first explain what it tries to do, before outputting the Python code needed to perform.
- Description of all the tools. This is defined by a `<<all_tools>>` token that will be manually replaced at runtime 
  with the tools defined/chosen by the user.
- Example of tasks and their solution
- Current example, and request for solution.

In order to specify a custom single-execution prompt, one would so the following:

```py
template = """ [...] """

agent = HfAgent(your_endpoint, run_prompt_template=template)
```

<Tip>

Please make sure to have the `<<all_tools>>` string defined somewhere in the `template` so that the agent can be aware 
of the tools it has available to it.

</Tip>

#### Chat-execution prompt

The chat-execution prompt is defined as such:
- Introduction: how the agent should behave, specifically as a chat-based assistant. Explanation of the concept of 
  tools. Mentions to the agent that it should first explain what it tries to do, before outputting the Python code 
  needed to perform.
- Description of all the tools. This is defined by a `<<all_tools>>` token that will be manually replaced at 
  runtime with the tools defined/chosen by the user.
- Example of chat-based tasks and their solution
- Current example, and request for solution.

In order to specify a custom single-execution prompt, one would so the following:

```
template = """ [...] """

agent = HfAgent(
	url_endpoint=your_endpoint,
	token=your_hf_token,
	chat_prompt_template=template
)
```

<Tip>

Please make sure to have the `<<all_tools>>` string defined somewhere in the `template` so that the agent can be 
aware of the tools it has available to it.

</Tip>

### Using gradio_tools with the agent

[gradio_tools](https://github.com/freddyaboulton/gradio-tools) is a powerful library that allows using Hugging 
Face Spaces as tools.

TODO complete this

### Using Langchain tools with the agent

We love [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html), and think it does a great job at implementing 
many tools that could empower this implementation. We show examples of how to leverage popular Langchain tools with 
this API.
