# FBGEMM FP8

```py
from transformers import FbgemmFp8Config, AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B"
quantization_config = FbgemmFp8Config()
quantized_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("llama_fp8", device_map="auto", quantization_config=quantization_config)

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
input_text = "What are we having for dinner?"
input_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")

output = quantized_model.generate(**input_ids, max_new_tokens=10)
print(tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True))

```

A quantized model can be saved via "saved_pretrained" and be reused again via the "from_pretrained".

```py
quant_path = "/path/to/save/quantized/model"
model.save_pretrained(quant_path)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(quant_path, device_map="auto")
```
