# ONNX Configurations

ðŸ¤— Transformers provides a `transformers.onnx` package that enables you to
convert model checkpoints to an ONNX graph by leveraging configuration objects.

We provide three abstract classes that you should inherit from, depending on the
type of model architecture you wish to export:

* Encoder-based models inherit from [`OnnxConfig`]
* Decoder-based models inherit from [`OnnxConfigWithPast`]
* Encoder-decoder models inherit from [`OnnxSeq2SeqConfigWithPast`]

See the [guide](../serialization) on exporting ðŸ¤— Transformers models for more
details.
