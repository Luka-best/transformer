# Generation

Methods for auto-regressive text generation, namely [`~generation_utils.GenerationMixin.generate`] (for the PyTorch models), [`~generation_tf_utils.TFGenerationMixin.generate`] (for the TensorFlow models) and [`~generation_flax_utils.FlaxGenerationMixin.generate`] (for the Flax/JAX models),  are defined in [`~generation_utils.GenerationMixin`], [`~generation_tf_utils.TFGenerationMixin`] and [`~generation_flax_utils.FlaxGenerationMixin`] respectively.
The *Mixin* classes are exposed in the base model classes [`PreTrainedModel`], [`TFPreTrainedModel`], and [`FlaxPreTrainedModel`] respectively, so that every model class
has access to the `generate` functions.
