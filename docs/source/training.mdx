# Fine-tune a pretrained model

[[open-in-colab]]

There are significant benefits when you use a pretrained model. It reduces computation costs and your carbon footprint, and allows you to use state-of-the-art models without having to train them from scratch. ðŸ¤— Transformers provides access to thousands of pretrained models you can use across many domains. When you use a pretrained model, you just need to train it on a dataset specific to your task. This is referred to as fine-tuning, an incredibly powerful training technique. In this tutorial, you will fine-tune a pretrained model with a deep learning framework of your choice:

* Fine-tune a pretrained model with ðŸ¤— Transformers [`Trainer`] API.
* Fine-tune a pretrained model in TensorFlow with Keras.
* Fine-tune a pretrained model in native PyTorch.

## Prepare a dataset

<Youtube id="_BZearw7f0w"/>

Before you fine-tune a pretrained model, you will need to download a dataset and prepare it for training. In the previous tutorial, you learned how to process data for training. Now you will put those skills to the test!

Begin by loading the [Yelp Reviews](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yelp_review_full) dataset:

```py
>>> from datasets import load_dataset

>>> dataset = load_dataset("yelp_review_full")
>>> dataset[100]
{'label': 0,
 'text': 'My expectations for McDonalds are t rarely high. But for one to still fail so spectacularly...that takes something special!\\nThe cashier took my friends\'s order, then promptly ignored me. I had to force myself in front of a cashier who opened his register to wait on the person BEHIND me. I waited over five minutes for a gigantic order that included precisely one kid\'s meal. After watching two people who ordered after me be handed their food, I asked where mine was. The manager started yelling at the cashiers for \\"serving off their orders\\" when they didn\'t have their food. But neither cashier was anywhere near those controls, and the manager was the one serving food to customers and clearing the boards.\\nThe manager was rude when giving me my order. She didn\'t make sure that I had everything ON MY RECEIPT, and never even had the decency to apologize that I felt I was getting poor service.\\nI\'ve eaten at various McDonalds restaurants for over 30 years. I\'ve worked at more than one location. I expect bad days, bad moods, and the occasional mistake. But I have yet to have a decent experience at this store. It will remain a place I avoid unless someone in my party needs to avoid illness from low blood sugar. Perhaps I should go back to the racially biased service of Steak n Shake instead!'}
```

As you now know, you will need a tokenizer to process the text, and include a padding and truncation strategy to handle any variable sequence lengths. Use ðŸ¤— Datasets [`map`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/process.html#map) method to apply a preprocessing function over the entire dataset. This way, you process your data in one step:

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-cased")
>>> def tokenize_function(examples):
...     return tokenizer(examples["text"], padding="max_length", truncation=True)
>>> tokenized_datasets = dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)
```

To speed things up in this tutorial, create a smaller subset of the full dataset to train on:

```py
>>> small_train_dataset = tokenized_datasets["train"].shuffle(seed=42).select(range(1000)) 
>>> small_eval_dataset = tokenized_datasets["test"].shuffle(seed=42).select(range(1000))
```

Nice, your preprocessed dataset is now ready for fine-tuning!

<a id='trainer'></a>

## Fine-tune with the Trainer API

<Youtube id="nvBXf7s7vTI"/>

PyTorch does not provide a training loop, so you would have to manually write one (see how [here](training#fine-tune-in-native-pytorch)). For greater user ease, ðŸ¤— Transformers has a [`Trainer`] class optimized for training ðŸ¤— Transformers models. The [`Trainer`] API supports a wide range of training options and features such as logging, gradient accumulation, and mixed precision.

Start by loading your model, and specify the number of expected labels. From the Yelp Review [dataset card](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yelp_review_full#data-fields), you can see there are five labels:

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification

>>> model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-cased", num_labels=5)
```

<Tip>

You will see a warning about some of the pretrained weights not being used and some weights being randomly
initialized. Don't worry, this is completely normal! The pretrained head of the BERT model is discarded, and replaced it with a randomly initialized classification head. You will fine-tune this new model head on your sequence classification task, transferring the knowledge
of the pretrained model to it (which is why this is called transfer learning).

</Tip>

### Training hyperparameters

Next, create a [`TrainingArguments`] class which contains all the hyperparameters you can tune, as well as flags to activate for different training options. For this tutorial, you can start with the default training hyperparameters (but feel free to experiment with these if you'd like). All you need to do is specify where to save the checkpoints from your training:

```python
from transformers import TrainingArguments

training_args = TrainingArguments(output_dir="test_trainer")
```

### Metrics

[`Trainer`] does not automatically evaluate model performance during training. You will need to pass [`Trainer`] a function to compute and report metrics. The ðŸ¤— Datasets library provides a simple accuracy function you can load with the `load_metric` (see this [tutorial](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/metrics.html) for more information) function:

```py
>>> import numpy as np
>>> from datasets import load_metric

>>> metric = load_metric("accuracy")
```

The `metric` has a `compute` method which calculates the accuracy of your predictions. But before you can pass your predictions to the `compute` method, you need to convert the predictions to logits (remember all ðŸ¤— Transformers models return logits):

```py
>>> def compute_metrics(eval_pred):
...     logits, labels = eval_pred
...     predictions = np.argmax(logits, axis=-1)
...     return metric.compute(predictions=predictions, references=labels)
```

If you'd like to monitor your evaluation metrics during fine-tuning, specify the `evaluation_strategy` parameter in your training arguments to report the evaluation metric at the end of each epoch:

```py
>>> from transformers import TrainingArguments

>>> training_args = TrainingArguments(output_dir="test_trainer", evaluation_strategy="epoch")
```

### Trainer

Create a [`Trainer`] with your model, training arguments, training and test datasets, and evaluation function:

```py
>>> trainer = Trainer(
...     model=model,
...     args=training_args,
...     train_dataset=small_train_dataset,
...     eval_dataset=small_eval_dataset,
...     compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
)
```

Then fine-tune your model by calling `train()`:

```python
>>> trainer.train()
```

<a id='keras'></a>

## Fine-tune with Keras

<Youtube id="rnTGBy2ax1c"/>

ðŸ¤— Transformers models can also be trained natively in TensorFlow with the Keras API. There are only a few changes to make before you can fine-tune.

### Convert dataset to TensorFlow format

First, you need a [`DataCollator`](main_classes/data_collator) to assemble your tensors into a batch. In this tutorial, you will use [`transformers.DataCollatorWithPadding`] to also apply a padding strategy. This will pad each input to the longest length in each batch (also known as _dynamic padding_), which will speed up your training. Make sure you specify `return_tensors` to return TensorFlow tensors:

```py
>>> from transformers import DataCollatorWithPadding

>>> data_collator = DataCollatorWithPadding(tokenizer=tokenizer, return_tensors="tf")
```

<Tip>

[`Trainer`] uses [`transformers.DataCollatorWithPadding`] by default, so you don't have to explicitly specify it.

</Tip>

Next, convert the tokenized datasets to TensorFlow datasets with the [`to_tf_dataset`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/package_reference/main_classes.html#datasets.Dataset.to_tf_dataset) method. Specify your inputs in `columns`, and your label in `label_cols`:

```py
>>> tf_train_dataset = small_train_dataset.to_tf_dataset(
...     columns=["attention_mask", "input_ids", "token_type_ids"],
...     label_cols=["labels"],
...     shuffle=True,
...     collate_fn=data_collator,
...     batch_size=8,
)

>>> tf_validation_dataset = small_eval_dataset.to_tf_dataset(
...     columns=["attention_mask", "input_ids", "token_type_ids"],
...     label_cols=["labels"],
...     shuffle=False,
...     collate_fn=data_collator,
...     batch_size=8,
)
```

### Compile and fit

Load a TensorFlow model with the expected number of labels:

```python
>>> import tensorflow as tf
>>> from transformers import TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification

>>> model = TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-cased", num_labels=5)
```

Then you can compile and fine-tune your model with the `fit()` method as you would with any other Keras model:

```python
>>> model.compile(
...    optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=5e-5),
...    loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
...    metrics=tf.metrics.SparseCategoricalAccuracy(),
)

>>> model.fit(train_tf_dataset, validation_data=eval_tf_dataset, epochs=3)
```

## Fine-tune in native PyTorch

<Youtube id="Dh9CL8fyG80"/>

[`Trainer`] takes care of the training loop, and allows you to fine-tune a model in a single line of code. For users who'd like to tinker with the code more and see what's happening behind the curtains, you can also fine-tune a ðŸ¤— Transformers model natively with PyTorch.

At this stage, you may need to restart your notebook or you can also execute the following code to free some memory:

```py
del model
del pytorch_model
del trainer
torch.cuda.empty_cache()
```

Next, you need to post-process your `tokenized_dataset` to get it ready for training.

1. Remove the `text` column because the model does not accept it as an input:

    ```py
    >>> tokenized_datasets = tokenized_datasets.remove_columns(["text"])
    ```

2. Rename the `label` column to `labels` because the model expects the argument to be named `labels`:

    ```py
    >>> tokenized_datasets = tokenized_datasets.rename_column("label", "labels")
    ```

3. Set the format of the dataset to return PyTorch tensors instead of lists:

    ```py
    >>> tokenized_datasets.set_format("torch")
    ```

Then you can create a smaller subset of the dataset as previously shown:

```py
>>> small_train_dataset = tokenized_datasets["train"].shuffle(seed=42).select(range(1000)) 
>>> small_eval_dataset = tokenized_datasets["test"].shuffle(seed=42).select(range(1000))
```

### DataLoader

Create a `DataLoader` for your training and test datasets:

```py
>>> from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

>>> train_dataloader = DataLoader(small_train_dataset, shuffle=True, batch_size=8)
>>> eval_dataloader = DataLoader(small_eval_dataset, batch_size=8)
```

Load your model with the number of expected labels:

```py
>> from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification

>>> model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-cased", num_labels=5)
```

### Optimizer and learning rate scheduler

Create an optimizer and learning rate scheduler to fine-tune the model with. Let's use the default optimizer used in [`Trainer`], [`AdamW`]:

```py
>>> from transformers import AdamW

>>> optimizer = AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=5e-5)
```

Next, create the default learning rate scheduler used in [`Trainer`]:

```py
>>> from transformers import get_scheduler

>>> num_epochs = 3
>>> num_training_steps = num_epochs * len(train_dataloader)
>>> lr_scheduler = get_scheduler(
...    name="linear",
...    optimizer=optimizer,
...    num_warmup_steps=0,
...    num_training_steps=num_training_steps
)
```

Lastly, specify `device` to use a GPU if you have access to one. Otherwise, training on a CPU may take several hours instead of a couple of minutes.

```py
>>> import torch

>>> device = torch.device("cuda") if torch.cuda.is_available() else torch.device("cpu")
>>> model.to(device)
```

Great, now you are ready to train! ðŸ¥³ 

### Training loop

Let's use the [tqdm](https://tqdm.github.io/) library to add a progress bar over the number of training steps so you know how far along the training is:

```py
>>> from tqdm.auto import tqdm

>>> progress_bar = tqdm(range(num_training_steps))

>>> model.train()
>>> for epoch in range(num_epochs):
...    for batch in train_dataloader:
...        batch = {k: v.to(device) for k, v in batch.items()}
...        outputs = model(**batch)
...        loss = outputs.loss
...        loss.backward()

...        optimizer.step()
...        lr_scheduler.step()
...        optimizer.zero_grad()
...        progress_bar.update(1)
```

### Metrics

Just like the [`Trainer`] class, you need to manually add an evaluation function to compute a metric. But instead of calculating and reporting the metric at the end of each epoch, this time you will accumulate all the batches with the [`add_batch`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/package_reference/main_classes.html?highlight=add_batch#datasets.Metric.add_batch) method and calculate the metric at the very end.

```py
>>> metric = load_metric("accuracy")
>>> model.eval()
>>> for batch in eval_dataloader:
...    batch = {k: v.to(device) for k, v in batch.items()}
...    with torch.no_grad():
...        outputs = model(**batch)
...
...    logits = outputs.logits
...    predictions = torch.argmax(logits, dim=-1)
...    metric.add_batch(predictions=predictions, references=batch["labels"])

>>> metric.compute()
```
