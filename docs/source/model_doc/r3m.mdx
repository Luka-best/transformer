# R3M

## Overview

The R3M model was proposed in ["R3M: A Universal Visual Representation for Robot Manipulation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12601)  by Suraj Nair, Aravind Rajeswaran, Vikash Kumar, Chelsea Finn, and Abhinav Gupta. The paper studies how to learn generalizable visual representation for robotics from videos of humans and natural language.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*We study how visual representations pre-trained on diverse human video data can enable data-efficient learning of downstream robotic manipulation tasks. Concretely, we pre-train a visual representation using the Ego4D human video dataset using a combination of time-contrastive learning, video-language alignment, and an L1 penalty to encourage sparse and compact representations. The resulting representation, R3M, can be used as a frozen perception module for downstream policy learning. Across a suite of 12 simulated robot manipulation tasks, we find that R3M improves task success by over 20% compared to training from scratch and by over 10% compared to state-of-the-art visual representations like CLIP and MoCo. Furthermore, R3M enables a Franka Emika Panda arm to learn a range of manipulation tasks in a real, cluttered apartment given just 20 demonstrations.*

Tips:

The expected input is a batch of images of size [Batchsize, 3, 244, 244], with values from [0-255].
