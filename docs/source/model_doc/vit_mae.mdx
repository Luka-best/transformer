# ViTMAE

## Overview

The ViTMAE model was proposed in [Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06377v2) by Kaiming He, Xinlei Chen, Saining Xie, Yanghao Li, Piotr Doll√°r, Ross Girshick. 
The paper shows that, by pre-training a Vision Transformer (ViT) to reconstruct pixel values for masked patches, one can get results after fine-tuning that outperform
supervised pre-training, and show promising results in terms of scaling behaviour.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*This paper shows that masked autoencoders (MAE) are scalable self-supervised learners for computer vision. Our MAE approach is simple: we mask random patches of the
input image and reconstruct the missing pixels. It is based on two core designs. First, we develop an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture, with an encoder that operates
only on the visible subset of patches (without mask tokens), along with a lightweight decoder that reconstructs the original image from the latent representation and mask
tokens. Second, we find that masking a high proportion of the input image, e.g., 75%, yields a nontrivial and meaningful self-supervisory task. Coupling these two designs
enables us to train large models efficiently and effectively: we accelerate training (by 3x or more) and improve accuracy. Our scalable approach allows for learning high-capacity
models that generalize well: e.g., a vanilla ViT-Huge model achieves the best accuracy (87.8%) among methods that use only ImageNet-1K data. Transfer performance in downstream
tasks outperforms supervised pre-training and shows promising scaling behavior.*

Tips:

- MAE (masked auto encoding) is a method for self-supervised pre-training of Vision Transformers (ViTs). The pre-training objective is relatively simple:
by masking a large portion (75%) of the image patches, the model must reconstruct raw pixel values. One can use [`ViTMAEForPreTraining`] for this purpose.
- After pre-training, one "throws away" the decoder used to reconstruct pixels, and one uses the encoder for fine-tuning/linear probing. This means that after
fine-tuning, one can directly plug in the weights into a [`ViTForImageClassification`].
