# DiT

## Overview

DiT was proposed in [DiT: Self-supervised Pre-training for Document Image Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02378) by Junlong Li, Yiheng Xu, Tengchao Lv, Lei Cui, Cha Zhang, Furu Wei.
DiT applies the self-supervised objective of [BEiT](beit) (BERT pre-training of Image Transformers) to 42 million document images, allowing for state-of-the-art results on downstream applications such as
document image classification, table detection and document layout analysis.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Image Transformer has recently achieved significant progress for natural image understanding, either using supervised (ViT, DeiT, etc.) or self-supervised (BEiT, MAE, etc.) pre-training techniques. In this paper, we propose DiT, a self-supervised pre-trained Document Image Transformer model using large-scale unlabeled text images for Document AI tasks, which is essential since no supervised counterparts ever exist due to the lack of human labeled document images. We leverage DiT as the backbone network in a variety of vision-based Document AI tasks, including document image classification, document layout analysis, as well as table detection. Experiment results have illustrated that the self-supervised pre-trained DiT model achieves new state-of-the-art results on these downstream tasks, e.g. document image classification (91.11 → 92.69), document layout analysis (91.0 → 94.9) and table detection (94.23 → 96.55). *

One can directly plug in the weights of DiT into a BEiT model, like so:

```python
from transformers import AutoModel

model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("microsoft/dit-base")
```

As DiT's architecture is equivalent to that of BEiT, one can refer to [BEiT's documentation page](beit) for all tips, code examples and notebooks.
