# Create a model manually

In the `AutoClass` [tutorial](autoclass_tutorial), you loaded a model by allowing the `AutoClass` to automatically infer the architecture and download the pretrained configuration and weights. While we generally recommend using an `AutoClass` to produce checkpoint-agnostic code, users who want more flexibility are able to manually create an instance of a ðŸ¤— Transformers model. This could be particularly useful for anyone who is interested in studying or experimenting with a ðŸ¤— Transformers model. In this guide, you will dive deeper into creating a model without a `AutoClass`. You will learn to:

- Load and customize a model configuration.
- Create a model.
- Create a slow and fast tokenizer.

## Configuration

A [configuration](main_classes/configuration) file stores model specific attributes. Each model configuration has attributes that are specific to it, but all models have the `hidden_size`, `num_attention_heads`, `num_hidden_layers` and `vocab_size` (if it is a text model) attributes in common. Attributes are used to build a model. 

For example, access [`DistilBertConfig`] to inspect the attributes used to build it:

```py
>>> from transformers import DistilBertConfig

>>> config = DistilBertConfig()
>>> print(config)
DistilBertConfig {
  "activation": "gelu",
  "attention_dropout": 0.1,
  "dim": 768,
  "dropout": 0.1,
  "hidden_dim": 3072,
  "initializer_range": 0.02,
  "max_position_embeddings": 512,
  "model_type": "distilbert",
  "n_heads": 12,
  "n_layers": 6,
  "pad_token_id": 0,
  "qa_dropout": 0.1,
  "seq_classif_dropout": 0.2,
  "sinusoidal_pos_embds": false,
  "transformers_version": "4.16.2",
  "vocab_size": 30522
}
```

This displays all the attributes used to build [`DistilBert`]. These attributes are also customizable, creating space for experimentation. For example, if you want to use a different activation function and change the dropout ratio for the attention probabilities, then:

```py
>>> my_config = DistilBertConfig(activation="relu", attention_dropout=0.4)
>>> print(my_config)
DistilBertConfig {
  "activation": "relu",
  "attention_dropout": 0.4,
  "dim": 768,
  "dropout": 0.1,
  "hidden_dim": 3072,
  "initializer_range": 0.02,
  "max_position_embeddings": 512,
  "model_type": "distilbert",
  "n_heads": 12,
  "n_layers": 6,
  "pad_token_id": 0,
  "qa_dropout": 0.1,
  "seq_classif_dropout": 0.2,
  "sinusoidal_pos_embds": false,
  "transformers_version": "4.16.2",
  "vocab_size": 30522
}
```

When you initialize a model with [`DistilBertConfig`], it creates a random instance of the model that needs to be trained first. It is much faster to use a pretrained model, and then customize it's attributes:

```py
>>> my_config = DistilBertConfig.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased", activation="relu", attention_dropout=0.4)
```

Once you are satisfied with your model configuration, you can save it with [`~transformers.PretrainedConfig.save_pretrained`]. This will save your configuration file as a JSON file in the specified directory:

```py
>>> my_config.save_pretrained(save_directory="./your_model_save_path")
```

To reuse the configuration file, load it with [`~transformers.PretrainedConfig.from_pretrained`]:

```py
>>> my_config = DistilBertConfig.from_pretrained("./your_model_save_path/my_config.json")
```

<Tip>

You can also save your configuration file as a dictionary or even only save the difference between your custom configuration attributes and the default configuration attributes! See [here](main_classes/configuration) for more details.

</Tip>

## Model

The next step is to create a [model](main_classes/models). The model - also loosely referred to as the architecture - defines what each layer is doing and what operations are happening. Each model will be different, but they all share the base class [`PreTrainedModel`] and a few common methods such as resizing input embeddings and pruning self-attention heads. All models are either a [`torch.nn.Module`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Module.html), [`tf.keras.Model`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model) or [`flax.linen.Module`](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/flax.linen.html#module) subclass. This means models are also compatible with each of their respective general framework usage.

Load the configuration attributes into the model:

```py
>>> from transformers import DistilBertModel

>>> my_config = DistilBertConfig.from_pretrained("./your_model_save_path/my_config.json")
>>> model = DistilBertModel(config)
===PT-TF-SPLIT===
>>> from transformers import TFDistilBertModel

>>> my_config = DistilBertConfig.from_pretrained("./your_model_save_path/my_config.json")
>>> tf_model = TFDistilBertModel(config)
```

This creates a model with random values instead of pretrained weights. You won't be able to use this model for anything useful until you train it. Training is a costly and time-consuming process and it is generally better to use a pretrained model. With a pretrained model, you can get better results faster while only using a fraction of the resources required for training.

Create a pretrained model with [`~transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`]:

```py
>>> model = DistilBertModel.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")
===PT-TF-SPLIT===
>>> tf_model = TFDistilBertModel.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")
```

When you load pretrained weights, the configuration is automatically loaded if the model is provided by ðŸ¤— Transformers. However, if you are really attached to your custom configuration, you can still use it with the pretrained model:

```py
>>> model = DistilBertModel.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased", config=my_config)
===PT-TF-SPLIT===
>>> tf_model = TFDistilBertModel.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased", config=my_config)
```

### Model heads

At this point, you've only created a base DistilBert model that outputs some *hidden states*. To make sense of these values, the hidden states are passed as inputs to a model head. The model head produces the final output. ðŸ¤— Transformers provides a different model head for each task, as long as your model supports it (i.e., you can't use DistilBert for a sequence-to-sequence task like translation).

Create a model head by instantiating it with your task. For example, let's use [`DistilBertForSequenceClassification`] for a sequence classification task. The sequence classification head is a linear layer on top of the pooled outputs.

```py
>>> from transformers import DistilBertForSequenceClassification

>>> model = DistilBertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")
===PT-TF-SPLIT===
>>> from transformers import TFDistilBertForSequenceClassification

>>> tf_model = TFDistilBertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")
```

You can easily reuse the checkpoint for another task by using a different model head. If you are interested in a question answering task, load [`DistilBertForQuestionAnswering`]. The question answering head is similar to the sequence classification head except it is a linear layer on top of the hidden states output.

```py
>>> from transformers import DistilBertForQuestionAnswering

>>> model = DistilBertForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")
===PT-TF-SPLIT===
>>> from transformers import TFDistilBertForQuestionAnswering

>>> tf_model = TFDistilBertForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")
```

## Tokenizer

The last class you need before you use a model is the [tokenizer](main_classes/tokenizer). A tokenizer prepares the model input by converting raw text to tensors. There are two types of tokenizers you can use with ðŸ¤— Transformers:

- [`PreTrainedTokenizer`]: a Python implementation of a tokenizer.
- [`PreTrainedTokenizerFast`]: a tokenizer from our Rust-based [ðŸ¤— Tokenizer](https://huggingface.co/docs/tokenizers/python/latest/) library. This tokenizer type is significantly faster - especially during batch tokenization - due to it's Rust implementation. The fast tokenizer also offers additional methods like *offset mapping* which can map the original words to it's generated tokens and even map each character to it's token.

Both tokenizers support common methods such as encoding and decoding, adding new tokens, and managing special tokens.

<Tip warning={true}>

Not every model supports a fast tokenizer. Take a look at this [table](index#supported-frameworks) to check if the model you're using supports a fast tokenizer.

</Tip>

If you trained your own tokenizer, you can create a tokenizer from your *vocabulary* file:

```py
>>> fast_tokenizer = DistilBertTokenizerFast.from_pretrained(vocab_file="my_vocab_file.txt")
```

However, as with a model, it is generally better and faster to use a pretrained model's vocabulary. Create a [`PreTrainedTokenizer`] with:

```py
>>> from transformers import DistilBertTokenizer

>>> slow_tokenizer = DistilBertTokenizer.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")
```

Create a [`PreTrainedTokenizerFast`] with:

```py
>>> from transformers import DistilBertTokenizerFast

>>> fast_tokenizer = DistilBertTokenizerFast.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")
```

<Tip>

An [`AutoTokenizer`] will try to load a fast tokenizer by default!

</Tip>

With these three basic classes - two if you use a pretrained model - you can use any ðŸ¤— Transformers model whether you are training one from scratch or fine-tuning one for your task.
