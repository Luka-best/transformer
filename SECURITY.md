## Using Transformers Securely
### Untrusted models
Be careful when running untrusted models. This classification includes models created by unknown developers or utilizing data obtained from unknown sources.

*Always execute untrusted models within a secure, isolated environment such as a sandbox* (e.g., containers, virtual machines). This helps protect your system from potentially malicious code.

Important Note: The trustworthiness of a model is not binary. You must always determine the proper level of caution depending on the specific model and how it matches your use case and risk tolerance.

### Untrusted inputs

Some models accept various input formats (text, images, audio, etc.). The libraries converting these inputs have varying security levels, so it's crucial to isolate the model and carefully pre-process inputs to mitigate script injection risks.

For maximum security when handling untrusted inputs, you may need to employ the following:

* Sandboxing: Isolate the model process.
* Pre-analysis: check how the model performs by default when exposed to prompt injection (e.g. using [fuzzing for prompt injection](https://github.com/FonduAI/awesome-prompt-injection?tab=readme-ov-file#tools)). This will give you leads on how hard you will have to work on the next topics.
* Updates: Keep your model and libraries updated with the latest security patches.
* Input Sanitation: Before feeding data to the model, sanitize inputs rigorously. This involves techniques such as:
    * Validation: Enforce strict rules on allowed characters and data types.
    * Filtering: Remove potentially malicious scripts or code fragments.
    * Encoding: Convert special characters into safe representations.
    * Verification: Run tooling that identifies potential script injections (e.g. [models that detect prompt injection attempts](https://python.langchain.com/docs/guides/safety/hugging_face_prompt_injection)). 

### Data privacy

When training the model with sensitive data, use trusted models and expose your newly-trained model to tests to identify potential sensitive data leaks.  

To protect sensitive data from potential leaks or unauthorized access, it is crucial to sandbox the model execution. This means running the model in a secure, isolated environment, which helps mitigate many attack vectors.

### Untrusted environments or networks

If you can't run your models in a secure and isolated environment or if it must be exposed to an untrusted network, make sure to take the following security precautions:
* Confirm the hash of any downloaded artifact (e.g. pre-trained model weights) matches a known-good value
* Encrypt your data if sending it over the network.

### Multi-Tenant environments

If you intend to run multiple models in parallel with shared memory, it is your responsibility to ensure the models do not interact or access each other's data. The primary areas of concern are tenant isolation, resource allocation, model sharing and hardware attacks.

#### Tenant Isolation

You must make sure that models run separately. Since models can run code, it's important to use strong isolation methods to prevent unwanted access to the data from other tenants.

Separating networks is also a big part of isolation. If you keep model network traffic separate, you not only prevent unauthorized access to data or models, but also prevent malicious users or tenants sending graphs to execute under another tenantâ€™s identity.

#### Resource Allocation

A denial of service caused by one model can impact the overall system health. Implement safeguards like rate limits, access controls, and health monitoring.

#### Model Sharing

In a multitenant design that allows sharing models, it's crucial to ensure that tenants and users fully understand the potential security risks involved. They must be aware that they will essentially be running code provided by other users. Unfortunately, there are no reliable methods available to detect malicious models, graphs, or checkpoints. To mitigate this risk, the recommended approach is to sandbox the model execution, effectively isolating it from the rest of the system.

#### Hardware Attacks

Besides the virtual environment, the hardware (GPUs or TPUs) can also be attacked. [Research](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=gpu+side+channel) has shown that side channel attacks on GPUs are possible, which can make data leak from other models or processes running on the same system at the same time.


## Reporting a Vulnerability

Beware that none of the topics under [Using Transformers Securely](#using-transformers-securely) are considered vulnerabilities of Transformers. 

However, If you have discovered a security vulnerability in this project, please report it privately. **Do not disclose it as a public issue.** We ask for at least 90 days before public exposure as it gives us time to work with you to fix the issue and reduce the chance that the exploit will be used before a patch is released.

ðŸ¤— We have our bug bounty program set up with HackerOne. Please feel free to submit vulnerability reports to our private program at https://hackerone.com/hugging_face.
Note that you'll need to be invited to our program, so send us a quick email at security@huggingface.co if you've found a vulnerability.
